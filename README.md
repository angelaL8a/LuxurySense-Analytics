# Fashion Analysis Project

## Abstract

This project focuses on analyzing the perception, historical relevance, entities involved, and fashion preferences of luxury brands Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Dior, and Versace based on articles from top fashion magazines. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and sentiment analysis, the project extracts and analyzes data to understand how these brands are portrayed in the media.

## Languages and Tools Used

- **Python**: Main programming language used for data analysis and processing.
- **Libraries**: BeautifulSoup, numpy, pandas, nltk, wordcloud, matplotlib, PIL, plotly.
- **Techniques**: Sentiment analysis, text mining, entity recognition, data visualization.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Collection**: Scraping articles from Vogue, Elle, Glamour, and Harper's Bazaar.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing dominant adjectives, historical words, entities, clothing items, and fabrics associated with each brand.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Evaluating positive and negative perceptions in fashion narratives.
4. **Data Visualization**: Creating visual representations including word clouds and sentiment distributions.
5. **Conclusion**: Summarizing findings on brand perceptions and preferences in fashion magazines.
