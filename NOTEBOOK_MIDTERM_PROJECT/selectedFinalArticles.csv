vogue,louis vuitton,Louis Vuitton,"Editor's note: This collection was originally presented in March 1998 in Paris and has been digitized as part of Vogue Runway's ongoing efforts to document historical fashion shows.  In the 1990s many heritage houses got makeovers as fashion increasingly corporatized. The trials and triumphs of John Galliano at Christian Dior and Alexander McQueen at Givenchy, for example, have been well documented. Marc Jacobs also ended up in Paris at a storied maison, but his remit was different. He was tasked with creating something from nothing—a ready-to-wear collection for a leather goods and accessory company which had never had one before. ""When Bernard Arnault asked me if I'd do it, it took me just about five seconds to say yes,"" Jacobs recalled in a 1998 interview with The Financial Times. ""Design is always subjective but quality is objective and that's what attracted me to Louis Vuitton.""  It so happened that Jacobs's debut, for fall 1998, coincided with Martin Margiela's for Hermès. The press dubbed this occasion ""The Battle of the Bags."" In so doing they made more noise than either designer, both of whom went in for different variations on simplicity. Jacobs's collection had an American in Paris vibe. There was almost a Puritanism to his spare shapes and limited palette. ""The collection of 50 outfits was so achingly hip, so New York minimal that its impact was severely muted,"" wrote The Guardian at the time. ""The clothes contain the sort of inverted snobbery that makes a secret society out of status. More shocking than Jacobs's understated approach was the fact that there was only one bag in the show, and it (like the clothes) had no visible logos. In introducing an entirely new category to Louis Vuitton's offering, Jacobs was starting at ground zero, and he translated that notion into designs as elemental and clean as the geometry of a trunk, an iconic LV piece that the designer referenced in a statement he contributed to the ""Backstage News & Notes"" feature that ran in the July 1998 issue of Vogue, which is reprinted below.  ""Marc on Vuitton""""I think people were expecting a lot of monograms. It's impossible to please everyone, but we started at zero—this was a company that had never done clothing before. The clothes were contemporary, classic, luxurious, a backdrop for a luggage company—utilitarian and practical. Was it too utilitarian for the French? Well, you know, one of the first Louis Vuitton trunks was gray and flat so it would be stackable. It was very practical; I mean, there's method to all this madness. Also, originally there was no monogram on the outside. Then Vuitton was copied so much he changed it to a stripe. Then a check. Then initials, which, by the way, were inspired by Japanese art in Paris at the time. I'm an expert on all of this now.  Vuitton is a luxury brand—it's functional, but it's also a status accessory. I decided status would be done my way, which is to say invisibly. That means the Vuitton logo is embossed on a messenger bag, white on white. For me that's what status is: It's absolutely not about another century or about decoration in an obvious way. The idea that everything has to be the same in fashion, that everyone has to follow one trend, that there is one kind of status is wrong. You can't compare a beaded dress to a simple cotton raincoat.  Also, I don't think of Louis Vuitton as French necessarily. It's international. I see Vuitton bags in airports all over the world. You look at Hello! magazine and there's John McEnroe in a white shirt, jeans, and a raincoat and carrying a Vuitton bag. That is the sexy, glamorous image of what Louis Vuitton should be."""
vogue,louis vuitton,How Ana de Armas’s Golden Globes Dress Channeled Old Hollywood,"As a nominee in the Best Actress in a Motion Picture Drama category at last night's Golden Globes, Ana de Armas was one of the evening's most-anticipated leading ladies. Her portrayal of Marilyn Monroe in Andrew Dominik's Blonde has been one of the most-discussed performances of the year. For the star, getting acknowledged by the Globes for the role made for a special night—especially given the part's challenges. ""What was most special about being a part of Blonde was the opportunity to work on a character that allowed me to push myself to my limits, and that made me work harder than ever,"" says de Armas. ""It taught me to be patient with the process and trust the team around me. It was the opportunity of a lifetime, and it changed my life forever.""  For the ceremony's red carpet, both de Armas and stylist Samantha McMillen wanted a formal look that paid homage to Marilyn Monroe's signature Old Hollywood style through a fresh modern lens. To do so, they landed on an architectural dress and jewelry from Louis Vuitton (she serves as a brand ambassador for the label). Designed by Nicolas Ghesquière, her strapless bustier gown featured a graphic front panel that was embroidered with 3D sequins in a geometric pattern. It took a total of 150 hours, 25 meters of silk, and 800 sequins to complete the design.  ""Even though it was black, it felt very light and effortless—in contrast with the beautiful modern centered panel in the front, with silver embroidery forming the unmistakable pattern of the Louis Vuitton flower,"" de Armas says. ""To me, it was elegant and made me feel comfortable and myself."" McMillen adds, ""It combined modern Louis Vuitton details with a classic Old Hollywood elegance. It was the perfect gown for this occasion and looked effortless.""  De Armas is no stranger to wearing Vuitton on the carpet, of course. Over the course of her press tour for Blonde, the star wore many statement gowns by the French label—her pleated pink gown from Venice being a standout. The star says she enjoys the art of working with the designer. ""Nicolas has a vision, and he is also a great collaborator. He always wants his people happy and feeling like themselves,"" says de Armas. ""For every red carpet we do, we share sketches, exchange ideas, and make little tweaks until the piece looks exactly how we like it. I think we complement each other very well because he understands my conservative side, and I love that he's a risk taker and pushes me in that direction.""  De Armas's beauty team—including makeup artist Mélanie Inglessis, hairstylist Jenny Cho, and manicurist Ashlie Johnson—wanted a simple look that ensured all eyes were on the dress. Inglessis wanted to create a Marilyn Monroe–inspired beauty look that combined classic glamour with a sense of ease and simplicity—just like her dress. ""We wanted her skin to be luminous, complemented by a sharp cat eye and a perfectly stained rosy-mauve lip,"" says Inglessis. ""She is wearing the [unreleased] shade Stolen Heart [by Estee Lauder], a matte rosy-mauve.""  As for what's next for de Armas? The actor is now right back to shooting her upcoming action-thriller film Ballerina, which exists in the John Wick universe and costars Keanu Reeves. She can't tell us much yet—but she teases just enough to get us excited. ""Ballerina is going to be a very fun movie, [with] lots of energy and stunning locations,"" says de Armas. ""[It's] action-packed with a great original dramatic story and a strong character at its core.""  Below, a closer look at de Armas's Golden Globes look."
vogue,louis vuitton,Louis Vuitton,"Rosalia jumped on the roof of a vintage yellow car and performed in a super-puffer and XXXL track pants, and Colm Dillane came out on stage in a green bucket hat with the whole menswear team. In between, there'd been a Louis Vuitton menswear collective composite of an event, collaged from Colm's ideas, the styling contributions of Ibrahim Kamara, a set conceived by the Gondry brothers—and a film by them which went out on LV channels, though was not seen by the audience—in a tent in the Cour Carrée du Louvre.  Attention grabbing communication combined with cult item creation is the giant luxury brand game these days. That's not just the case with the Louis Vuitton menswear department, of course, although this brand has entered a phase of taking special care over what's to be done about creative continuity since the tragic loss of the man who uniquely convened such a vast global community around it.  Bringing in Dillane with his can-do, cheerful, collaborative personality, and his Brooklyn self-taught anything-can-be-done hustle is one measure of the company's will to keep the flame of Virgil Abloh's legacy burning. In the official phrase, Dillane was ""embedded"" within the maison—that is, working with Abloh's remaining studio team. Along with Kamara, they actioned his ideas about re-doing classic menswear suiting and respecting the universal language of track suits, hoodies, and trainers at the same level—and with witty, surreal messaging and references to Black culture to go with it.  Another possibility is that the naive name and hand-drawn artwork of Dillane's own brand, KidSuper, had a bearing on it. His multicolored child-like paintings of people and domestic interiors were hyper-elaborated into Vuitton patchworked tracksuits and jacquarded onto a suit, formal coat, and a souvenir LV Keepall.  The link there is that Abloh always spoke about the importance of remembering and cherishing the child within the adult—a symbol to him of hope. And that turned out to be the trope that was conjured up again in the set for this show—rooms in a house in which a child had grown up to be a man.  As Rosalia sang, models could be seen behind her rummaging through a Louis Vuitton trunk to find packed-away childhood toys. Program notes detailed the idea of millennial rites of passage, teenage bedrooms, and early memories of playing on computers.  When the models emerged onto the runway at the perimeter of the set, they were wearing mash-ups of classical cuts, suits with twisted middles, and—it being the trend of the season—several long slim tailored coats. Dillane's input included faces patchworked in leather in neutral colors on LV monogram casual wear, backpacks, and a bucket hat.  The collective nature of the show—some of this, some of that, and a lot of individual items to chat about—made it hard to read as a coherent narrative. Above and beyond that, the maison's superb ability to innovate wildly luxurious techniques was in no doubt. What might happen next with LV remains to be seen. Dillane's graffiti in yellow on a gray topcoat seemed to say that: ""Blurry Vision of a Bright Future,"" it read."

vogue,chanel,Coco’s Hollywood: The Chanel Cruise Is Heading to Los Angeles,"After recent stops in Monte Carlo and Provence, Chanel will unveil its next cruise collection in Los Angeles.  The show, which will take place on May 9th (that's the second Tuesday in May in case you're curious), is the second time the storied French maison has shown in the City of Angels. In 2007, Karl Lagerfeld staged an extravagant show for the cruise 2008 collection—even by Chanel standards—in a Santa Monica hangar with the models coming out of two giant Challenger 601 jets, which according to our review of the show, ""elicited a standing ovation before the first model hit the people mover.""   Chanel Cruise 2008  Chanel Cruise 2008  The set is likely to be a lot different this time around, the press release describes the first time Coco Chanel visited Los Angeles was in 1931, on the invitation of the producer Samuel Goldwyn, who asked her to dress Hollywood actresses. Does this mean the collection will pay homage to old Hollywood glamour? Either way, we'll be watching."
vogue,chanel,Apple Martin on Attending Her First Fashion Show ,"Yesterday's Chanel spring 2023 couture show in Paris was, unsurprisingly, a star-studded affair. A-listers such as Tilda Swinton, Marion Cotillard, and Vanessa Paradis were all in attendance. However, there was a new face among the celebrity-filled crowd. Apple Martin, the 18-year-old daughter of Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow, took in her first fashion show from the front row. ""The Chanel Couture show was my first fashion experience, and I am so incredibly grateful to Chanel and their incredible team for having me,"" says Martin. ""It was so exciting to see the art in the designs, and the theme of the line emerge throughout the show.""    Martin's favorite looks were those that had an upbeat, youthful feel. ""My favorite looks from the show were the dropped-waist short tweed looks, and the white floor-length dresses,"" says Martin. ""I particularly loved look 40, 23, and 18."" Martin is a big fashion fan and follower, so it was only a matter of time before she got to witness a real-life show from one of her favorite labels. ""I really enjoy keeping up with fashion,"" Martin says. Ahead of the show, she paid a special visit to le19M, Chanel's new architectural space dedicated to showcasing its Métiers d'Art fashions and artisans.   Given her VIP seat at the show, Martin brought a fashion-forward look for the occasion. She wore a total look by Chanel including a black and white tweed dress with a matching jacket from the label's spring 2023 collection. In addition to a classic quilted bag and chunky loafers, she also wore fine jewelry pieces—including an 18-karat gold bracelet and necklace with diamonds—and a Première Edition Originale timepiece. ""I wanted my look to encapsulate Chanel's timelessness, while adding edge with a strong eye look,"" says Martin. ""My favorite part of the look was the combination of the loafers and the minidress. It's something that felt very true to my own style.""  Now that Martin has proven herself a fashion girl, something tells us we'll be seeing even more of her in the front rows—maybe even this upcoming fashion month. Of what one can expect of her style, Martin says you can expect classic, modern getups—with a twist. ""I can't say that I am super trendy,"" says Martin. ""I love sweaters and oversized cardigans, loafers, and a good pair of comfy Levis. The most important thing for me is feeling like my genuine self when wearing an outfit; I'm aiming for a mix of classic '90s and cool grandpa.""  Below, see how Martin got ready for her first Chanel Couture show."
vogue,chanel,Chanel’s Cool-Girl Waves Are Springtime’s Easiest Hair Trend,"Springtime's biggest hairstyle? Take notes from Chanel's spring 2023 show, where insouciant cool-girl waves floated over models's shoulders as they walked the runway. From soft waves to more defined curls, in true Chanel style, the hair was perfectly polished—not a flyaway in sight.  While the fashion house is known for its love of barrettes and hair bows, this time, there were few hair accessories to be seen. In their place were minimalistic center partings and low-key curls that felt more easy-breezy than in seasons past. On the front row, Vanessa Paradis and Sadie Sink both showed off their own take on the cool-girl waves, proving it's a trend to try for women of all ages.    A glossy red lip brought all the glamour, punctuating otherwise bare, healthy-looking complexions. It was a beauty look with just the right hint of je ne sais quois—one that could have been borrowed direct from the most chic residents of Paris.   For a similar style, get your hands on a pair of straighteners and try the S-wave technique. A hairdresser favorite, all you have to do is take a piece of hair, create an S-shape, and then press the straightener plates over the curve to set it. And voila, there you have it: hair worthy of the Chanel runway.  Jennifer Lopez Confirms Milky Nails Are the New French Manicure  What Are the Best Colognes for Men?

vogue,chanel,Chanel,"What could a conceptual camel be doing at Chanel couture? This puzzle—the first sight to greet the audience as they walked in—can easily be solved by googling Coco Chanel's apartment. What swiftly comes up are photos of Chanel at home in the Rue Cambon, with a model of a camel on a side-table, large bronzes of deer clustered around her fireplace, and lion effigies here, there, and everywhere. Virginie Viard held a tete-a-tete with the artist Xavier Veilhan to come up with a set idea for the spring couture show in said apartment and—you can picture it—they must've looked around and said to each other ""let's do the animals!""  Hey presto! A playful idea that got Viard into the swing of a theme—a parade of something between cute Chanel drum majorettes, or perhaps, circus ringmasters. They flipped along in their short, flared suits with the odd top hat and bow tie, shod in little white cross-laced boots with Chanel's signature black-tipped toes. By this time, they were walking around Veilhan's menagerie of mobile animal sculptures—a horse, lion, deer, buffalo, bird, fish, dog, and elephant—which had been trundled out to join the camel.  Still, it's not in Viard's nature as a creative director to push a concept over clothes. Instead, here was a collection of haute couture that felt youthfully relatable. The spectacle of her march of the majorettes simply became a device for freshening up the template of Chanel day suits, led out by a charming military-jacketed number in white.  That was followed by varieties of abbreviated, gilded Chanel tweeds: a short trapeze coat, de-frumpified box-pleated skirts cut as minis, and then a tiny sugar-pink coat-dress with a stand-away collar. It was a bit '60s Mod maybe, but not too obviously.  Proceeding ""not too obviously"" might actually be Viard's motto. So it was, when the collection switched from short and sweet daywear to long and slim evening. Within this sequence, there was a chic, neat, parma-violet short sleeved tweed coat, worn with white leather opera gloves, and long, body-skimming dresses in tiny polka dots, and black or white lace.  Asked afterward if she'd been thinking 1930s with these languid dresses, Viard looked as if vintage Chanel collections hadn't crossed her mind. ""No,"" she shrugged. ""That silhouette might make you think it, but no.""  Back to her reticence about committing to themes, again. Of course, there's no rule that designers should have to stick to high concepts. Sometimes, truth be told, they can really get in the way of designers just designing clothes for modern life. Instead, Viard is a ""modern wardrobe for real women"" kind of a designer. Her collections aren't fantasy, even if she well knows how to conjure up the magic of the couture ateliers to make pieces that look like snowy, frothy whipped cream.  And then, at the finale, out popped the bride from a hidden door in the elephant. She was wearing a little white dress entirely covered with embroidered doves and a white bow tie. It was a light-touch moment, simple and rather charming. Much like the spirit of the rest of the show."
vogue,dior,Dior Men,"Kim Jones has been turning to his extensive collection of rare books once again. He brought in Robert Pattinson and Gwendoline Christie to recite The Waste Land, T.S. Eliot's epically difficult, melancholic poem written in the aftermath of World War I. Jones owns six copies of this work of English literature which is considered to be pivotal to the modernism of exactly a century ago; so there were the faces of Pattinson and Christie, filmed by Baillie Walsh, and blown up on massive screens as the models walked past.  All that's just to fill in the background. What Jones took from the meaning of this most British of works, the school exam subject which has tortured the brains of generations of teenagers, was to do with its themes of time passing, death and renewal. ""For me, I read it as about renewal and change; times changing,"" he said before the show. ""So it begins with Christian Dior dying, and then Yves Saint Laurent coming in and suddenly doing new things. And there's a lot of me in it.""  To parse the fashion stanzas: there were pale, neutral colors, a looseness and fluidity, layerings of transparent trails streaming from the backs of trousers (a trend, oddly, that's been turning up in several shows). There was a moment for jackets and sweaters embroidered with tiny chains of abstracted lily of the valley, the early spring flower-favorite of Christian Dior. Then, as Christie and Pattinson spoke Eliot's passages on death by drowning, there were conceptual life jackets with tonally matched buoyancy pads, riffs on seafarer's Aran knits, voluminous A-line storm coats, takes on yellow seafaring oilskin raincoats, and sou'westers.  The references to Saint Laurent's time at Dior—it was fleeting, in 1958—were anchored in Jones's study of the gray over-the-head wool tunic he made; itself a revolutionary reference to fisherman's traditional workwear, but transgressively (for the time) upgraded to haute couture. Jones said he'd also examined the young Yves's penchant for animal print (there was a faux leopard lining visible in a slash-sided trench coat), and how he created volumes with vents in his raincoats.  It was more of a flavor, perhaps a nod to fashion history geeks (both old and young—competitive discussion of references is very much becoming a TikTok and Instagram video thing) rather than any straight-up replication of past looks. As for the ‘Me' element Jones spoke about, that was surely in the evolution of the distinctively tailored suit that is his alone—the minimal, lapel-less single-breasted jacket over flowing trousers. It has both a captivating sensitivity and an elegance about it.  Over the long run, Jones has been a pioneer in bringing street references into high fashion, and then insisting on applying Christian Dior's women's templates to menswear. As times move on, it's a measure of Jones's influence that the skirts—and shorts so wide that they look like skirts—in this show now pass as quite normal. He's working in 2023, not 1923, like T.S. Eliot. English academics the world over might be aghast at Eliot's poetry being used in a fashion show, but the two Britishers at least have this in common: being out to change the discipline they work in, mediating between history and the future."
vogue,dior,How Yara Shahidi Got Her Modern Flapper Beauty for Dior’s Couture Show,"When preparing to attend a couture show, there are myriad paths to take on the style front. Exaggerated? The better to echo the general air of the shows. Understated? Allowing the striking silhouettes to do the talking. Or—even better—a balance of the two? For Dior's Spring 2023 Couture showing, Yara Shahidi played off of the collection's inspiration, her woven tulle mini and trademark curls bringing to mind a contemporary flapper in the vein of Dior muse Josephine Baker.   ""My forever first step before starting hair and makeup is to do a self-care check-in,"" says Shahidi, who joined stylist Jason Bolden, hairstylist SherriAnn Cole, and makeup artist Emily Cheng for her pre-event glam. ""When I feel good, I love how I look!"" To play up the actor's texturized dress, Cole cultivated Shahidi's cloud of curls, keeping the crown as buoyant and fluid as the edgings of fabric. Makeup centered on soft neutrals, with Diorshow Iconic Overcurl serving lift and drama, the lip a study in careful coordination. Cheng also looked to the dress for guidance, echoing the palette while playing up Shahidi's natural bone structure. Brushed-up brows, neutral shadow, and a dusting of bronzer ensured the moment was an entirely warm one, Cheng's addition of Dior Rouge Blush in 459 Charnelle providing a balancing, youthful swirl of pink.   ""Makeup artist extraordinaire Emily Cheng chose colors that complement my dress,"" says Shahidi, whose own luminous skin and ready smile lent to the liveliness of the look. All in all, Shahidi's beauty embodied the spirit of the collection and of the actor herself: effervescent and effortlessly glamorous.   The most exciting part of getting ready is discovering inspiration from all that is around us!  Taking our time to apply lip liner, lipstick, and balm gives me color that lasts!  Jason Bolden, my incredible stylist, helps me communicate how I want to feel...through theclothes that he presents to me! We have lots of conversations that always seem to end with awonderful clothing adventure!  Finishing off my look with Diorshow Iconic Overcurl because it's featherlight and appliesbeautifully."
vogue,dior,Kiss Curls Get a Modern Makeover on the Dior Couture Runway,"Elegance reigned at Dior's spring 2023 couture show, where Maria Grazia Chiuri evoked the roaring '20s with an homage to the iconic dancer-turned-civil-rights-activist Josephine Baker. A symphony of silver, models were sent down the catwalk in glittering bias-cut gowns with beaded fringing that recalled the glamour of the cabaret.   Backstage at Dior's couture show in Paris.   As for the beauty, Peter Philips brought the drama with a bold charcoal smoky eye, touched with accents of shimmer. ""I highlighted the eyes with a combination of black shadows blended with silver in a transparent way,"" says Philips. ""It is a slightly blurred, unpolished smoky eye, which plays on light effects and provides an element of mystery."" The look was created using slate gray and silver shades from the 5 Couleurs Couture 079 Black Bow palette, which Philips applied on the upper eyelid, blending out towards the temples, as well the lash line of the lower eyelid. ""The result was a simultaneously dark yet bright look that was a bit blurred, and not too polished.""   Skin, meanwhile, was matte and flawless, prepped with the Dior Prestige skincare routine, which features the Micro-Huile de Rose Advanced Serum, Crème Texture Essentielle and the Micro-Serum de Rose Yeux Advanced for the eye area. This was topped with Dior Forever Glow Veil primer for added radiance. So as not to detract from the eye, lips were left natural, with a hint on sheen courtesy of the Rouge Dior Mitzah Collector patted onto the curves.   Channeling the sultry glitz of the Jazz Age, hairstylist Guido swept the hair back into glistening updos, styled at the front with contemporary kiss curls. ""Baby hairs, updos, braids, and short haircuts—the '20s are back in all different forms at Dior,"" he said.   Jennifer Lopez Confirms Milky Nails Are the New French Manicure  What Are the Best Colognes for Men?

vogue,dior,Christian Dior,"Maria Grazia Chiuri came across archive pictures of Josephine Baker performing in Dior couture in New York in 1951 in New York. The shining American-born French Black star and civil rights activist came to perform in Paris in 1925, becoming a leading light of the Jazz Age cabaret and a French citizen. In World War II, she joined the French Resistance, and in 2021 was finally honored as one of the greats of the French nation when her name was inscribed at a solemn ceremony at the Pantheon in Paris.  What an inspiration for the creative director to relate to—especially after the discovery that Baker had been a client of the house. ""She was really an incredible, empowered woman,"" Chiuri said in a preview at Dior headquarters. She dedicated the spring haute couture to her, and surrounded the show with a gallery of portraits commissioned from Mickalene Thomas featuring a new pantheon of similarly ground-breaking Black and biracial Hollywood actors and models of the 20th century, with Josephine Baker at its center.  Instead of leaning literally on the famous imagery of Baker as a showgirl, Chiuri took a more subtle, pared-back approach. She'd studied, too, less well-known photographs of Baker in restaurants, wearing day-suits, and in uniform during the war. The collection was all the more quietly powerful for it.  ""The line in this collection is more '20s,"" she said. ""More clean, less volume, more my attitude."" Her project, as she sees it more generally at Christian Dior, is ""to renovate"" and render the classical canon of the house to be lighter and easier to wear—and especially, now, to answer the growing requests from couture customers for daywear.  There were shimmery Deco-like beaded shifts that somehow recalled flapper dresses, for sure. Definite moments of green-room looks, with silver tap-pants or structured lingerie, but covered up with velvet dressing gown coats. A third of the way in came an outstanding gold cloque midi suit, the jacket recalling the iconic 1947 Bar jacket, but structured, sans corsetry to skim the body rather than nip.  She took the same clever approach to de-boning and un-fussifying the grandeur of the off-the-shoulder Dior ballgown, using artfully creased satins, in slate gray, liquid silver, or pale gold. These effects had a beautiful simplicity—like ideal heirloom dresses rediscovered in a family trunk.  But the real surprises were in the time Chuiri took to show her sober and impeccably-cut tailoring: the simplicity of double-breasted Dior gray skirt suits; a minimally perfect tuxedo coat; long, slim silhouettes in black. All there was in the way of decoration was on the feet: velvet, embroidered, ankle-strapped platform sandals. It will surely be more than enough to have modern-minded clients racing to Christian Dior to fill that yawning gap in chic things to wear for the day."
vogue,versace,We Can’t Get Enough of Pat McGrath’s “Very Versace” Eye Look,"Last night in Los Angeles, Versace carried fashion month into Hollywood's biggest weekend with a blowout show at the Pacific Design Center. Fittingly, the beauty was ""modern Hollywood glamour infused with a rebellious punk rock twist,"" according to makeup artist Pat McGrath, a longstanding collaborator of Donatella Versace, who has worked with the designer since the '90s.   ""The thing that we've had in common since day one is that we approach each project with a shared sense of excitement and adventure,"" McGrath says of taking risks and breaking the rules together. ""She's a true visionary with a unique perspective on beauty and fashion that's all her own."" In that spirit, McGrath crafted a ""very Versace"" graphic eye as the ""ultimate accessory to the collection,"" inspired by who else but Donatella herself.  ""We were running around looking for latex tape in Paris,"" McGrath says of securing the secret weapon tool behind the look's ""perfectly structured wing shape."" A glistening shine—the handiwork of layers of different inky textures—furthered the impact of the razor-sharp design. To create the look, McGrath started with her cult-favorite PermaGel Ultra Glide Eye Pencil and Perma Precision Liquid Eyeliner in Xtreme Black, topped with the same shade of shadow and Black Metal from the Mothership III Subversive palette, then added a custom blend of metallic pigments and glitter. Finally, the hand-cut black latex tape finished the look for a multidimensional flick.   This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.  ""It was a look that embodied the spirit of Versace with just the right amount of edge and attitude,"" says McGrath. This held true with a ""classic tribute to Donatell's signature nude lip"" as well, the pro tracing pouts with Permagel Ultra Lip Pencil in Supernatural and finishing things off with a slick of Lust Gloss in Faux Real. ""I wanted the makeup to represent the Versace woman while she radiates confidence, power, and sophistication,"" she emphasizes.  From the runway to the front row, where stars like Pamela Anderson and Lil Nas X echoed the fierceness on the catwalk, the show was brimming with energy.  ""After the whirlwind of Paris fashion week, everyone was ready to have a good time,"" says McGrath. And the Versace show delivered just that—and a heavy dose of makeup inspiration—as it kicked off Oscars weekend.

Show,"Celebrities were out in full force at Versace's fall 2023 show in Los Angeles on March 9, despite the last-minute decision to bring it forward by a day due to the weather forecast. Naomi Campbell led a starry supermodel cast on the runway, while Lil Nas X, Miley Cyrus, Ariana DeBose, Elton John, and Dua Lipa lined the front row.   Anne Hathaway, meanwhile, delivered yet another bombshell moment at the event—attending wearing a croc-embossed minidress, tights, platform boots, and sunglasses from Versace, accessorized with Bulgari jewelry.   The actor wore another Versace look on the red carpet later that day.   The same day, she headed to the Taglyan Complex for the Hollywood Beauty Awards, and picked another Versace LBD to wear on the red carpet. Here, Hathaway opted for a sculpted maxi dress featuring a corseted bodice and spiked neckline, stamped with Versace's signature gold Medusa motifs on the straps.   The actor's two Versace outings succeed a string of head-turning outfits she's worn of late, including the sheer Valentino gown and hooded Alaïa look she wore at the Berlin Film Festival last month. According to Hathaway's stylist Erin Walsh, the actor's radiant ""glow"" brings her looks to life. ""That doesn't just come from clothes,"" Walsh previously told Vogue.

vogue,versace,"From Cher to Miley Cyrus, See All the Stars at Versace’s Los Angeles Spectacular","Last night, Donatella Versace headed to Los Angeles to stage her first Versace show in the city in more than 20 years—and pulled out all the stops. Any fears that the fashion extravaganza's last-minute change of timing (due to inclement weather, it was pulled forward a day in the run-up to the Oscars this weekend) might curb the ability of celebrities to attend were unfounded: the event was one of the most star-studded of the entire fashion season.  Not only did the runway spectacular—which took place on a theatrical raised platform above the Pacific Design Center, with sweeping views over the city's rooftops at sunset—feature a star-studded lineup of models that included Naomi Campbell and Gigi Hadid, but Versace brought out the cream of Hollywood to celebrate the occasion, too.  Naturally, the show attracted plenty of acting royalty. Anne Hathaway showed up in a killer LBD and a pair of Donatella-worthy, towering platform heels, while Oscar-winner (and latter-day meme queen) Ariana DeBose wore a show-stopping gown featuring see-through black crystal netting and stilettos. From Danielle Deadwyler to Lily James, Gabrielle Union to Pamela Anderson, the actors in attendance all fully embraced the Versace spirit of full-throttle glamour.  But the show also attracted an impressive mix of pop stars, too, with many of them opting for the night's more playful looks. Cher made an appearance with her new boyfriend Alexander Edwards, while Miley Cyrus, who is also celebrating the release of her latest album Endless Summer Vacation today, went for a more delicate look featuring reams of pink and black chiffon overlaid with serpentine chains. And that's without even mentioning the likes of Dua Lipa, Elton John, and Lil Nas X—last night, it's safe to say, the stars were out.  Here, see all of the celebrity arrivals to Versace's fall 2023 show in Los Angeles."
vogue,versace,Versace,"The forecast rarely calls for rain in Los Angeles, but when it does, things tend to grind to a halt. It's why the folks at Versace made the decision to reschedule their much-anticipated open air show from Friday to Thursday at the 25th hour. Mercifully that didn't stop the house's circle of Hollywood fans from showing up in Beverly Hills last night. The likes of Dua Lipa, Miley Cyrus, Channing Tatum, Anne Hathaway, and Lil Nas X all came out to support Donatella Versace, as well as lifelong friends like Elton John and Cher who sat front row with her record executive boyfriend on the roof of the landmark Pacific Design Center.  ""I mean I love this city, I love the people, the laid back vibe, the atmosphere,"" the designer said in a preview interview. At this time of year in particular, the city is a home away from home for Versace—after all she's spent many an Oscar weekend working with award nominees as they make the final touches on red carpet looks. The time around though, the spotlight was all hers.  To set the tone for house's destination show, Versace circled back to a pivotal mid-'90s moment. Easily the most prominent inspiration images on the moodboard for the collection were Richard Avedon's 1995 images of Kristen McMenamy. The chic skirt suit that McMenamy wore in those photos was tailored close to the body and replete with the brand's signature gold buttons.  ""I wanted to go back to the cut and shape of the clothes, to concentrate on the perfect little black dress, the perfect black suit,"" Versace said. Gigi Hadid opened the show dressed in a look that echoed those elegant proportions. She wasn't the only super in the house either: Versace favorite Naomi Campbell took her turn on the runway in an ankle-grazing black dress with an embellished bustier. Kendall Jenner, who like her friend Hadid was mostly absent from fashion week, stepped out to close the show in a teeny tiny LBD, glittering cropped cape, and classic pink satin pumps.  For celebrities that were still shopping for Oscar dresses, there were options aplenty. Some of the standouts: a crystal-encrusted naked dress that called to mind a modern Marilyn Monroe, a slinky black chainmail number with sculptural floral embellishments, and va-va-voom interpretations of the cone bra worked into various hourglass shapes.  Still, it was daywear that won the night, starting with Hadid's neatly tailored black skirt suit. Even the denim was cut with razor sharp precision—paired with a billowing white shirt, the slightly flared creased blue jean was easily one of the most covetable pairs of the season. There was a smart reinvention of the denim tuxedo as well, in the form of a funnel neck denim jacket with a sophisticated watteau back that was paired with a pencil skirt.  After the show, guests gathered to enjoy cocktails and admire the view as the sun set over snow-capped mountains. Many of the models joined the throng, still dressed in their runway gear. With dramatic black swooshes painted across their eyelids and satin slingbacks on their feet, they looked especially glamorous even among this well-heeled crowd, some of whom were only just getting started for a weekend of non-stop events. For the fashion editors and buyers in the house though, it was an epic bang of a season finale."
glamour,louis vuitton,Stylist Law Roach Sets the Record Straight on That Rumored Zendaya Feud,"As much as the internet loves a feud, celebrity stylist Law Roach is not going to let conspiracy theorists get between him and Zendaya.  On March 16, Roach sat down with The Cut editor-in-chief Lindsay Peoples to discuss the retirement announcement that shocked the fashion world. Earlier this week the famed stylist surprised everyone when he revealed he was stepping back from the ""politics"" and ""lies"" of the fashion business. With little else to go on, fans on TikTok and Twitter quickly began pointing to a recent video of Roach and Zendaya at a Louis Vuitton fashion show to explain his sudden exit. In the short clip, Zendaya is seated in the last available front-row spot while Roach appeared visibly unsure where to sit.   Despite Roach's specifically calling out ""false narratives"" in his retirement post, many were quick to make assumptions that Roach felt spurned by the fashion house as well as Zendaya, who was seen in the video pointing to a seat behind her. Roach corrected these feud rumors almost immediately, but now he's directly addressing the video.   This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.  During his conversation with Peoples, Law Roach explained that he and Zendaya were already flustered after getting stuck in traffic and running late to the show. ""It was a lot of anxiety because Zendaya is really respectful and she doesn't like people to have to wait on her,"" Roach said. ""I'm always used to sitting next to her. And so, in my mind, my seat was next to her. So when I got there and it wasn't, you know, it wasn't a problem, but there was nobody to tell me where my actual seat was. And so the seat behind her, when you see her turn around and touch the seat, it wasn't her telling me to sit there, it was her telling me like, ‘That's Darnell's seat,' which is her assistant. I'm not gonna sit in Darnell's seat. So then where does he go? And so I was standing there—I was really just kind of confused.""  Roach went on to explain the importance of sitting next to Zendaya in order to gauge their feelings about the clothes in real-time. ""That's part of our relationship and our interaction, seeing the clothes together,"" he said. ""And you know, the little cues, and little such, like, that's the look.""  This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.  Still, he was sure to explain that there was no tension between him and Zendaya, nor does he have beef with Delphine Arnault, the CEO of Christian Dior and daughter of LVHM CEO Bernard Arnault, who was seated next to the Euphoria star.  ""Somebody was like, ‘Law, you have to sit,' and I was like, ""I don't know where I'm sitting,'"" Law said. ""That became really tough because it made people think that Zendaya wasn't taking care of me and wasn't making sure I was taken care of. And then it became this thing with Delphine Arnault. I was like, Where did that come from? And so, now I have a beef with LVMH, and there's no beef with LVMH. Delphine and the Arnault family have been so kind to me. Like, even after the show, we went to the after-party. I had a whole conversation with her and congratulated her on her move to Dior. She sent me a beautiful bag, and it's like, there's no beef.""  Just because Roach is ""definitely, 100,000 percent retiring,"" doesn't mean his business relationship with Zendaya is over. ""People will say, ‘Oh, you not gonna leave Zendaya.' But I don't have to style Zendaya to be a part of her team and her creativity team, right?"" he said. ""So maybe if I choose, you know, not to be her stylist, I can still be her creative director and I can still, you know, manage a stylist or however I choose to do it. I haven't made a decision. She's giving me the grace to be able to make that decision because we really have a kinship. Like, you know, we've grown up together. And that's all I ever asked, was for people who I worked so hard for to just give me grace when I need it."" "
glamour,louis vuitton,Cate Blanchett’s Louis Vuitton Dress Has a Cape and Pockets,"Cate Blanchett was the picture of elegance at Cannes Film Festival on May 19. The actor walked the red carpet for the premiere of The Zone of Interest in a black-and-white Louis Vuitton dress with a cape detail and sequined silver pockets—yes, the dress has pockets! And we all know how the girlies love dresses with pockets.  The column gown traded color for chrome, as the belt had a structured silver clasp. The detail toughens the classic silhouette by adding a metallic edge. The front of the dress featured a black panel across her chest that fell over her shoulders into a long cape with white lining. The little details made a big impact, but none shone brighter than the Lord of the Rings star's oversized pockets.   All dresses should have pockets, especially if you're walking on a red carpet, and Blanchett's do not disappoint. The depth makes them the perfect size for stashing away anything you'd need for a last-minute touch-up, like a quick lipstick refresh; they also gave Cate Blanchett somewhere to place her hands when she posed for the cameras.   Cate Blanchett's hair was pulled back into a neat updo, and her makeup was a soft contrast to the black-and-white color palette.   But did we mention…the pockets?  "

The front row was brimming with personalities, all dressed head-to-toe in the latest LV.   Pharrell took the helm at Louis Vuitton following the passing of Virgil Abloh, and his debut show for spring-summer 2024 took place on top of the Pont Neuf, symbolising a figurative bridge between his hometown in Virginia and his new home in the French capital. Alongside upholding Abloh's legacy and finding inspiration in pivotal moments from his own life, Pharrell delved into contemporary interpretations of the iconic LV Damier pattern.

""It wasn't my decision to be here. I was shocked that they called me; it's an enormous opportunity to have a hand in highlighting beautiful things in a time where that's hard to hold. It's the job of an artist to take a disgusting and ugly thing and transmute it, put it through your body, and pop out something more beautiful and more helpful. Something considered and not something knee-jerk reactive.""  She continued, ""We're living in the most reactive, emotionally whiplashed time.

In 2021 she was appointed a global ambassador for the house for both fashion and beauty, and has been a regular on the front row at Dior shows ever since.   The inspiration for Maria Grazia Chiuri's spring-summer 2023 couture collection was Josephine Baker, but Jisoo channeled Audrey Hepburn on the front row, sporting a wispy fringe, a neat bun, and a feline flick that was reminiscent of the actor's signature look.   Jisoo attending Dior's spring-summer 2023 couture show.  Creative and image director of Christian Dior makeup Peter Philips was behind the nostalgic beauty look and also oversaw the makeup on the runway. Meanwhile, the Blackpink musician's chosen outfit—a white dress with a sheer shirt beneath from Chiuri's autumn-winter 2022 couture show—echoed Hepburn's penchant for elegant, feminine silhouettes and a monochrome palette.   Accessories-wise, the singer was one of several guests carrying the maison's iconic Lady Dior bag, a style loved by the late Princess Diana, who was regularly seen with the patent black and navy versions hooked over her arm.

glamour,dior,We Tried Dior Beauty’s Addict Lip Maximizer Gloss and It’s a Y2K Dream,"When TikTok becomes obsessed with a product, there's no escaping it. Few products have reached viral holy grail status, but Dior Beauty struck gold last year with its famous Lip Glow Oil, which seemed to be all over our feeds and became impossible to find in stock. Now the brand has done it again with the new and improved Dior Addict Lip Maximizer lip gloss, a revamped version of the original beloved formula, videos of which have already racked up 22.1 million view on TikTok.   It's no surprise that Dior Beauty created another obsession-worthy lip gloss that checks off all the boxes: high shine, hydrating ingredients, wide shade range and finishes, and no stickiness. Made with 90% natural-origin ingredients, the glosses contain hyaluronic acid and cherry oil for ultimate comfort and promise up to six hours of volume and shine.   But most impressive are the shades, a gorgeous range that spans classic neutrals and bold avant-garde colors. Two intensity options offer both sheer and intense color payoff, so whether your vibe is more clean-girl or vinyl goth glam, you'll be covered. There are also four different finishes—for those who want some extra shine, pearly and holographic will create that '90s-inspired frosted lip look, while classic and intense will make your lips look glassy and plump. And if you loved the minty smell of the Lip Glow Oil, you're in luck: The Addict Lip Maximizer has the same refreshing scent.   We put Dior Addict Lip Maximizer to the test, and these shades are some of Glamour editors' favorites. Scroll to see our honest reviews.   There are a few things that influenced my shade choice. Maybe it's my current obsession with Y2K sparkles, maybe it was Taylor Swift's trippy ""Lavender Haze"" music video. Regardless, this shade makes me so happy. In the tube it reads as extra sparkly and purple, but once applied, it's subtle and sheer with the faintest hint of lavender. You can't tell by the photo, but different lighting brings out the cool blue iridescent flecks—hence the holographic finish. Plus, the packaging makes me feel like I'm a hot mean girl in a rom-com whipping out her fancy lip gloss.     Dior Addict Lip Maximizer Gloss  Dior  Sephora  Ulta  I finally understand why Dior's Lip Maximizer is as popular as it is. Not only does it deliver a Y2K-worthy, high-shine finish without any stickiness—something I'm very weary of (a fly landed on my upper lip and got stuck when I was wearing so much Juicy)—but it plumps your lips ever so slightly without any burning or stinging. The tinted version also gives your pout the perfect pop of pigment for a soft-glam look, making the Maximizer the ideal lip product to keep in your bag or at your desk (which I now do). It's my favorite way to complete a full face of makeup, or feel a bit more put together when going barefaced. TikTok, you did good.    Dior Addict Lip Maximizer Gloss  Dior  I usually stray from a plumping gloss because of the tingling and uncomfortable feeling. However, the Dior Addict Lip Maximizer's ""plumping"" effect tingles but does not hurt at all. The gloss is hydrating, plumps slightly with a minty feel, and looks natural, almost like a clear gloss with a perfect shine for a nice, subtle everyday look.     Dior Addict Lip Maximizer Gloss  Dior  It was love at first sight with Dior's Intense Rosewood, a poetic shade of pink that goes on sheer and gives this just-bitten look that reminds me of Kirsten Dunst's Popsicle-stained lips in The Virgin Suicides. A refreshing tingle stays behind, along with a smooth, lasting sheen you can build on as the day goes by.

glamour,dior,Natalie Portman Revived One of the Most Famous Dior Gowns of All Time on the Cannes Carpet,"The 76th Cannes Film Festival has already delivered a slew of breathtaking red-carpet looks, including Elle Fanning's Alexander McQueen ""dress of dreams"" for the opening ceremony and Naomi Campbell's crimson Valentino gown with a pink feathered cape at the Killers of the Flower Moon screening. However, Natalie Portman's arrival at the May December premiere in a glittering custom Dior number that's an ode to a museum piece really captivated die-hard fashion enthusiasts.  The actor's ivory strapless gown—meticulously adorned with ornate beading and featuring a layered skirt reminiscent of a fan of eyeless peacock feathers—is inspired by the Junon dress that Christian Dior himself created for his 1949–1950 autumn-winter collection (named after the Roman goddess, who was wife to Jupiter and patron goddess of Rome). Although it's not currently on display, the original dress is a part of The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute collection.  The original Junon gown, on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  While Portman's look—which was dreamt up by Dior's current creative director, Maria Grazia Chiuri—pays homage to the legendary piece, the construction and fabrication of the garment are not identical to the original. This has divided the internet's style watchers, with some praising the reference (""This is insane,"" asserts fashion Twitter account @SaintDoII), and others, like Cherie Balch of Shrimpton Couture, suggesting that certain historic gowns just shouldn't be recreated. (Naturally, the vintage expert advocates for true archive over recreations on the red carpet.)  ""Natalie looked stunning, and her place as a long time ambassador of the house certainly justifies remaking this gown,"" Balch noted on Instagram. ""But, for me, the reproduction pales in comparison—the line is not quite right, the embellishment is less, and the movement didn't have the ease and beauty of the original.""  The dress has been referenced on numerous occasions in the past at Dior, as well as by other design houses. Some of the most notable moments include dresses from John Galliano's spring 2010 haute couture and Grazia Chiuri's spring 2017 haute couture collections at Dior, as well as Zuhair Murad's bespoke scalloped number for British Vogue's June cover star, Miley Cyrus, which she wore to the 2009 Oscars.

glamour,versace,Anne Hathaway Continues Her Bombshell Streak at Versace’s LA Show,"Celebrities like Anne Hathaway were out in full force at Versace's autumn-winter 2023 show in Los Angeles on March 9, despite the last-minute decision to bring it forward by a day due to the weather forecast. Naomi Campbell led a starry supermodel cast on the runway, while Lil Nas X, Miley Cyrus, Ariana DeBose, Elton John, and Dua Lipa lined the front row.   Hathaway, meanwhile, delivered yet another bombshell moment at the event, wearing a croc-embossed minidress, tights, platform boots and sunglasses from Versace, accessorized with Bulgari jewelry.   On the same day, she headed to the Taglyan Complex for the Hollywood Beauty Awards, and picked another Versace LBD to wear on the red carpet. Hathaway opted for a sculpted maxidress that featured a corseted bodice and spiked neckline, stamped with Versace's signature gold Medusa motifs on the straps.   The actor wore another Versace look on the red carpet later that day.   It's the black bralette underneath for me.  By Alexis Gaskin  The actor's two Versace outings succeed a string of head-turning outfits she's worn of late, including the sheer Valentino gown and hooded Alaïa look she wore at the Berlin Film Festival last month. According to Anne Hathaway's stylist, Erin Walsh, the actor's radiant ""glow"" brings her looks to life. ""That doesn't just come from clothes,"" Walsh previously told British Vogue. ""It comes through stepping into your potential and embracing possibility.""    This article first appeared on British Vogue.  "
glamour,versace,Emily Ratajkowski’s Vintage Versace Dress Was Worn by Another It Girl 21 Years Ago,"After her ethereal turn in Tory Burch on the red carpet at the Met Gala, Emily Ratajkowski wore not one but two additional looks to the after-party she hosted with stylist Carlos Nazario, model Paloma Elsesser, Luar designer Raul Lopez, and photographer Renell Medrano.  This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.  For the initial celebrations, Ratajkowski wore a sheer corseted custom look by Dilara Findikoglu, complete with a pearly, Chanel-inspired belt that read ""EmRata."" But it's her second look—a purple sequined Versace minidress sourced from Archive Vintage—that has created the most buzz on social media.  Emily Ratajkowski wore a vintage Versace dress for the Met Gala after-party she hosted.  Chloë Sevigny wore the same Versace dress in 2002.  The look in question, from Versace's spring-summer 2002 show, was worn by another It girl some 21 years earlier. Chloë Sevigny wore the same dress at the Versace Couture launch party at the Ritz Paris in July 2002—months after its debut on the runway—and shared a throwback picture of herself in the dress on her Instagram Stories, shortly after Ratajkowski posted her look online. Sevigny styled the dress with a very 2002 accessory: a chunky layered necklace.   Emily Ratajkowski has championed vintage Versace before. She wore a look from the Atelier Versace spring-summer 1992 collection to last year's Met, originally modeled by Yasmeen Ghauri on the runway. Besides Versace, her growing vintage wardrobe also includes archive pieces from Chanel, Armani, and Dior.  This article first appeared on British Vogue.  "
glamour,versace,Irina Shayk Is a Bombshell in a Rare Vintage Versace Slip,"On and off the red carpet, stars and their stylists are now favoring archive pieces over fresh-off-the-runway looks—and Irina Shayk is no exception.   Whether it's Zendaya wearing an autumn-winter 1998 Bob Mackie gown for the Time 100 Gala or Miley Cyrus on the cover of British Vogue in a Prada set from the spring-summer 2009 collection, we have never seen such a spotlight on vintage fashion as we have so far in 2023. Shayk recently gave us a fashion history lesson, wearing a rare archive Versace slip dress.  Over the weekend while still in Cannes, the model shared a series of images on her Instagram account wearing a metallic seafoam blue bias-cut slip dress with sheer paneling down one side; the dress is from Versace's spring-summer 1995 collection. Supermodel Linda Evangelista happened to walk the runway in this dress at the show in the '90s. Shayk completed the look with silver strappy sandals and gold statement earrings, which is perfectly in keeping with the high-shine finish of the dress.

elle,louis vuitton,Pharrell Williams Is Louis Vuitton's New Creative Director,"After much speculation, Louis Vuitton has announced its next men's creative director: musician and producer Pharrell Williams.  The French luxury house shared the news today, adding that Williams' first collection will debut during men's fashion week in Paris this June. It doesn't come as a complete surprise as Williams has worked on collaborations with the brand dating back to 2004.   ""I am glad to welcome Pharrell back home,"" said Pietro Beccari, Louis Vuitton's chairman and CEO, in a press release.   The last person to hold the title was the legendary Virgil Abloh of Off-White fame. He served as Louis Vuitton's men's creative director until November 2021, when his death shook the fashion industry.   For the past two decades, Williams has been known for his creativity and style. Aside from hit songs like ""Happy"" and his Daft Punk collaboration ""Get Lucky,"" he has made space for himself in the beauty and fashion realms. He started his own skincare brand, Humanrace, in 2020 and is a long-time collaborator with Adidas and Tiffany & Co.  "
elle,louis vuitton,Louis Vuitton Goes Baroque on Isola Bella for Cruise 2024,"One of the greatest tales of transformation is the story of a mermaid going from sea to land, turning into a human and experiencing what goes on above the water's surface. The Little Mermaid—and the live-action remake of the 1989 Disney classic hitting theaters tomorrow—was perhaps top of mind for Louis Vuitton creative director Nicolas Ghesquière, along with Venetian Baroque balls, sea nymphs, and even Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut, as he set sail yet again for the brand's cruise 2024 show.   The opulent setting this time around was Isola Bella, a tiny, majestic island situated in the middle of Lake Maggiore in northern Italy, and has been in the Borromeo family for centuries, replete with 10 gardens and a massive palace. Against the backdrop of the verdant blue water, the show took over the entire island to tell the tale of creatures of land, sea, and, it goes without saying, beauty.   Those familiar with Ghesquière know that the designer has been an avid user of neoprene and scuba materials for over two decades, including his iconic work for Balenciaga and several instances during his tenure at Louis Vuitton. This season took it to the next level, with trompe l'œil water droplets and scales printed on scuba tops, jackets, and one-piece scuba swimsuits juxtaposed with linen opera coats.   The wonders of the sea continued to strike a balance against earthly pleasures with hypnotic fish scale skirts paired with cropped jackets and massive encrusted feather and metal headpieces. Gorgeous beaded dresses bore a striking resemblance to stained glass windows, draped just so over the body. Elsewhere, colorblocked minidresses, one of Ghesquière's staples, were layered, ruched, and bunched to perfection, never once losing their technical rigor or excitement. Paired with masquerade masks in metallic finishes, they looked like lost relics from a Venetian ball, brought into the future.   As the show progressed, tulle started frothing like waves from sleeves and hips, and the beading became more intricate, reflecting the raindrops that fell on the island during the show like lost pearls turning on the sea floor. The finale parade, in a rainbow of pastel hues, completed the transformation from sea to earth, with mermaid dresses in delicate silks and brocades ribbon-lined on the bias, almost giving the effect of Ariel herself emerging from the sea for the first time. For just a moment, sea and earth, hard and soft, human and animal all converged and blended for a presentation that honored the rich Baroque history of the island while conveying hard-won romance that is sure to delight any die-hard fans of Louis Vuitton—or The Little Mermaid.

elle,louis vuitton,Miranda Kerr Is the Face of Louis Vuitton's Pacific Chill Perfume,"Miranda Kerr is a woman who wears many hats. To the public, she's the veteran Australian supermodel who rose to fame waltzing down Victoria's Secret runways as an Angel. Beauty obsessives know her as the CEO of KORA Organics—a skin care brand that channels the uplifting energy of nature into products formulated to nourish from head-to-toe. To her three sons, she's a mother who dedicates every minute of her day to ensure they're cared for, and quells any storm—even the after-school rush—ahead of an interview. ""My son just came home from school and is calling for ‘mommy,' so I had to get him all settled,"" she tells me over Zoom as she gets ready to start our interview.  With an impressive array of titles to her name, Kerr embraces the unpredictability of each day, and her commitment to wellness underpins every project she touches. To realign and recharge her own sense of ""chill,"" she seizes every opportunity to indulge in self-care, whether it's embarking on a family hike, engaging in early-morning meditation, or practicing yoga. ""I love health and wellness, and learning ways to nourish the mind, body, and spirit. For me, I always want to be the best partner, the best mother, and the best boss,"" she affirms. Or, a refreshing spritz of her new fragrance: Louis Vuitton's Pacific Chill.   Today, Kerr throws another proverbial hat in the ring as the face of Louis Vuitton's new Pacific Chill eau de parfum,  the latest addition to LV's California-inspired scents under master perfumer Jacques Cavallier-Belletrud and L.A. artist Alex Israel's fragrance bromance. Where Spell on You and City of Stars twirled around in gardens, Pacific Chill returns to the sea. A comforting blanket of citrus notes burst after the first spritz and slowly shifts to the background to make room for the chill: mint and basil. Blackcurrant rounds out the scent composition, which feels a lot like a tangy mojito on a beach—or, the fruit detox juice Belletrud had that spawned the idea of the perfume in the first place. ""It has a little squeeze of lemon and some fresh herbs that smell like an invigorating summer's day,"" Kerr says.   Here, Kerr tells us about fronting Louis Vuitton's new campaign, prioritizing self-care, and the best-smelling person she knows.   I love how Pacific Chill has this refreshing, uplifting aroma. The whole concept is all about inspiring the senses to get you into that serene mode, the energizing force of the ocean, and connecting the body and the spirit to bring about that sense of well-being. Scents evoke so many feelings within all of us. And this one really does make you feel like you're by the ocean.  One of my first memories with fragrance was watching my mom getting ready by her dressing table. It has so many beautiful bottles of different fragrances, and she had a couple of pieces of costume jewelry there. My cousin and I would sit there and play around with those little bottles and pretend that we were little ladies getting ready to go out. I remember we gave each fragrance bottle its own little story. From the moment you experience smelling the bottle, it opened up its own world and story.  The story here is about being on the ocean on the California Coast. The artwork was inspired by [L.A. artist] Alex Israel, and his favorite place, the Pacific Palisades hike, with that beautiful view of the ocean. Pacific Chill is all about the outdoors, prioritizing wellness and health, and the beauty of nature.  My relationship with fragrance has evolved over the years. I remember smelling my first gardenia in the garden at my grandparents' house. Actually, there was a rose bush there that my grandpa had planted for my grandma. I used to cut the roses off there and give them to my grandma, so my relationship with fragrance started there. Then, my mom also was very much into essential oils. As I got older, I become interested in peppermint aromatherapy, and how that feels very uplifting. Rose has always felt very nurturing to me. There's a different scent for every occasion. Pacific Chill itself is really inspiring to wear for the summertime. What I like to do is either spray a little on my clothes before I wear them, or on the ends of my hair, so you kind of get a little waft when you're walking by. I like that it's not too overpowering and captures wellness in a bottle. So, I guess that's my signature for now.   Probably just going for a walk with my children and my husband. We actually love going on family walks, being out in nature, and having the ocean breeze in our hair. Having a little family picnic is really the perfect day.   If you take time to give back to yourself, then you can give so much more to others. I enjoy exercising six days a week—and that's a mix of yoga, pilates, weight lifting, and running. I really look forward to quality time with my family. We love going on hikes together or just having a picnic outside under the trees in nature. I wake up super early so that I can get my meditation in and a little skin care routine before the kids wake up. Now that I have three kids and a business that I run, I don't read as much as I'd like to, but I do keep books next to my bed so I can read a couple of lines before I go to sleep at the end of the day. Currently, I'm reading How to Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk.  I love learning about anything to better my relationship with my children, because they teach us a lot as well. I also love crystals. I've always loved crystals—clear quartz and amethyst and citrine. I've just always been really drawn to crystals, the energy they bring, and how they can create more balance in our life. Affirmations are really important, too. If we can check ourselves and try to be kind and gentle with ourselves, then we're so much more kind and gentle with others.    Oh, my babies. That unconditional love that you feel for your child, it's like nothing else.  The ocean.  Apple pie baking in the oven. I do like to bake, yes. My kids love my apple pie.  My husband, of course. He has his own smell. I'm just so attracted to it; it's clean and fresh. It must be the endorphins. Nine years later, [they're] still working. "
elle,louis vuitton,Rihanna's Full Louis Vuitton Men's Campaign Is a Stunning Portrait of Her Pregnancy,"Pharrell Williams and Rihanna just teased her Louis Vuitton men's campaign for its spring/summer 2024 collection earlier this month. The rest of the photos and a gorgeous video, which feature Rihanna modeling Williams' pieces, were released this morning. Check out the footage above.   Shot by Keizō Kitajima and Martine Syms, Rihanna appears carrying William's new take on Louis Vuitton's Speedy bag—one that, per the house's press release, ""is informed by the cosmopolitan nucleus that inspired Pharrell Williams' early education in luxury: Canal Street on Lower Manhattan, New York City.""   The bag, in its bright hues, is the focal point of Rihanna's campaign images.   Rihanna was chosen to front the campaign during her pregnancy as she is ""a symbol of human empowerment and the quintessential everyday icon,"" the house wrote, noting that the images reflect ""the re-contextualization at the core of Pharrell Williams' approach to the Maison.""  This is Williams' first campaign since becoming creative director of Louis Vuitton menswear. His tapping Rihanna hits a personal note, as the pair have been friends and musical collaborators for years.   Williams spoke about Rihanna in November 2020, raving to Allure about her and her work so far on her highly-anticipated ninth album. She previously teased that she was working with Williams and his producing partner, Chad Hugo of The Neptunes and N.E.R.D., in February 2020.  ""Rih is in a different place right now,"" Williams told Allure. ""Like, wow. She's from a different world."" He then joked that she may just be from Venus: ""I'm willing to bet, because Venus is gaseous, that if they had a telescope that could zoom through all that sh*t, you'd see Rih laying there naked.""

elle,chanel,"If You Like Perfume, Then You'll Love Chanel's New Fragrance Exhibition","You can smell perfume, but you can't see it—or can you? Chanel's newest fragrance exhibition in Paris, Le Grand Numéro de Chanel, allows you to do both. The exhibition features a series of experiences that will tickle the heart of any perfume lover or perfume explorer through a mix of cabaret, live music, art installations, fashion displays from the archives, and virtual reality immersions. (We have a feeling Emily in Paris would definitely be first in line to visit).  In real life, celebrities such as Sadie Sink, Keira Knightley, and Marion Cotillard visited the exhibition. Sink told me, ""In today's world, you can go into a big beauty store and smell 60 different fragrances to try. In this exhibit, you slow down and get to better appreciate every single little detail.""  Case in point: Inside the main room, you can find interpretative dancers twisting and turning with bottles of Chanel N°5 (and even magicians). Head to the smaller break-out rooms, each headlined by a major Chanel fragrance, and you'll experience card games, live-action chess games, and fragrance psychoanalysts who can match you with scents based on your personality. The visuals are all so very TikTok-friendly.   ELLE talked to Chanel's house perfumer Olivier Polge to learn more about the secrets of Chanel N°5, as well as the surprises to be found in the exhibition. You can visit the exhibit in Paris starting now through January 9; make a reservation here.   Don't have very preconceived ideas. Just be yourself and come with your history and personality. Hopefully, you will discover perfumes differently. There are often perfume exhibitions with commercial posters or empty bottles. As we manufacture our perfumes ourselves, we really wanted to have, aside from all those visual aspects, a real experience of scents. In preparing for the exhibition, we tried to figure out which perfumes and which ingredients to show, if any. But we found that the best way to smell perfumes was not to be overexposed to them. We smell better if it's the correct amount of perfumes. It's always dangerous to fragrance the whole room.  Would you be able to smell 70 perfumes, or better to show about 10 that you will remember well?  What surprises me the most, and I saw the exhibition for the first time yesterday, was the space and how big it is. I cannot wait to see the comments from everyone who will visit. People are often very unconscious about all the scents that surround them.   Perfume and fashion were two different worlds, and [Gabrielle] Chanel was the first one to come up with a perfume with her own name. She saw it as a different way to express herself—her personality and her style. My intention is never to tell, or to go too much into the history. Gabrielle's history has been translated into her style. Often, when people ask me, ""Where do you find your inspiration?"" I say, ""This is more a way of being. When you are creative, everything  inspires you."" This is why I prefer to speak about style and history, but it's maybe a little bit the same. When you think about  new scents, it's important that it makes sense and that it resonates somehow to the others.  It would be a pity to ignore that.  We came up with a line, Les Eaux de Chanel, and I liked it very much, because when you think about scents, you always picture someone with a scent, or places. Those are things that anchor scents into your mind. As I was thinking about the scents, I realized that all those destinations evoked images and started to build something in Chanel's style. For example, Chanel went to Venice in the 1920s, and this is probably where she developed a taste for the Venetian art that you see often in certain pieces of jewelry.   The opposite. I have nothing to say. It's difficult to speak about perfumes. Yes, the language of a perfume is scents. They express things. They make a mark on yourself that words will not do. I'm not saying it's better. I think it's interesting to say, because these are things we cannot explain.  If the exhibition could talk, I would hope that it would tell you something you didn't know.  They are so different that it's difficult to see overlaps. Karl was quite passionate about perfumes. The last time I saw him, I was afraid he would speak to me about a perfume I didn't know. He knew every perfume out on the market for the past 50 years. I'm exaggerating a bit, but in his early life, he had worked with or for [Jean] Patou when he was very young, and Patou came up with many, many perfumes. He knew about perfumes that don't exist anymore, so he was quite an expert.  First of all, it's a great perfume,  with an identity that you organize right away. Gabrielle Chanel has said that with N°5, she wanted an artificial perfume—meaning one that doesn't represent exactly the scent of jasmine or a rose, but that is more  abstract [and] probably more mysterious.   There is something about Chanel N°5 that you cannot grasp. I think it's beyond the raw materials. We preserve N°5 with its original raw materials. We even bought certain jasmine fields to make sure that we would have the quantities at the quality we need. On the one side, we are always very careful to preserve N°5 in its original iteration, but also work regularly with new interpretations, to try to bring something new within No°5 as well.  We constantly maintain N°5 as if it was a new perfume, and that helps.  I also like to remember that Gabrielle Chanel herself was the first face of N°5. There was a picture of her in the first commercial. Then, in the 1950s, Marilyn Monroe said that all she would wear at night would be a few drops of N°5. All those things go beyond our planning.   Yes. When I say artificial, I mean abstract—we don't try to do Rose by Chanel or Vetiver by Chanel. We always try to express something else. I would say that about all our perfumes to a certain extent. That is a signature of Chanel fragrance. And the other important thing is this composed aspect—artificial—but that goes all the way to raw materials that are selected or transformed, in the way we extract them. We twist the identity of nature. We are never trying to reproduce nature.  This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. "
elle,chanel,Blackpink's Jennie Wears a Chanel Band-Aid to Paris Fashion Week After Recent Injury,"The Band-Aid is the new beauty mark—just ask Jennie Kim. Ushering in the era of bandagecore, the Chanel ambassador stepped out at Paris Fashion Week today as a VIP guest for the brand's fall/winter 2023 show. The Blackpink singer caught no shortage of flashbulbs, owing, certainly, to the ivory tweed Chanel jumpsuit she'd slipped into, but a certain adhesive bandage tucked underneath her right eye didn't hurt either. She—or, more likely, some sort of makeup genius—had manipulated the patch into her beauty look, rendering it almost invisible. As Coco Chanel herself once said, ""Adornment, what a science!""  Pairing a smoky, winged eye with peachy foundation and a pale pink lip, Jennie matched the Band-Aid to her exact skin tone, perhaps in an effort to ward off the concerns of her fervent, worried fan base.   On March 3, during a break from Blackpink's world tour, the singer preemptively shared her recent injury with fans, posting on the fan community Weverse: ""I was taking care of my health during the break, eating well, sleeping well, but I tripped while exercising and fell down so I got a bit of a scar on my face ... It's still healing, so I think I'm going to wear a bandage on my face for a while.""   As effortless as the look might appear, Jennie revealed to i-D that the morning's beauty routine had, in fact, taken three hours to pull together, and required immersing her face in an ice bath. For those hoping to mimic the beat—without hours of getting-ready time to spare, and who'd prefer to keep their ice in their drinks—maybe just the Band-Aid will suffice?  "
elle,chanel,Blackpink's Jennie Transforms Into Human Chanel in a White Minidress for Her Met Gala Debut,"Blackpink's Jennie Kim made history headlining Coachella with Rosé, Lisa, and Jisoo, and now, the K-pop star is hitting another milestone: attending her first-ever Met Gala. The Chanel ambassador, dubbed ""human Chanel"" by her fans, arrived at the Met Gala honoring the fashion house's late creative director Karl Lagerfeld. Jennie was naturally decked out in full Chanel, wearing a vintage Chanel white minidress, adorned with a white rose. She accessorized with black tights and heels.  Jennie is having one of her biggest years ever in her career. In addition to her work with Blackpink, she is part of the long-delayed series The Idol, where she'll act alongside Lily-Rose Depp and The Weeknd. The show will be premiering at the Cannes Film Festival.  Jennie spoke to ELLE for its December 2022/January 2023 issue about how she de-stresses amid all that's happening in her career. ""For the past few years, having my close friends, having my family around, and just trying to balance that work life and personal life was very important for me,"" she said. ""Because once you get caught in one life, if that's not balanced, I think that's when everything starts collapsing. I don't think one specific thing could de-stress me because we've got something going on every single moment, but keeping a positive mind, just taking care of your mental health and your body, is definitely something that I do...I meditate, stretch, read, sleep.""  She also revealed that making her acting debut in an American series was not something even she could've anticipated before it happened. ""The thing is, it was definitely not planned,"" she said. ""I've had a dream of acting in the future, as I was doing so many different parts already as an artist, so I've always wondered what it would be like. But the opportunity just came to me so naturally one day. And I just knew that it was something that I would regret if I didn't go for it.""  "
elle,chanel,"Chanel Hits The Gym, Beach, And Red Carpet","The team at Chanel has been busy, to say the least. Between staging the Met's new Costume Institute exhibit honoring Karl Lagerfeld, longtime creative director, dressing a bevy of stars including house ambassadors Penélope Cruz and Blackpink's Jennie for the Met Gala, and opening a brand-spanking-new 30,000 square-foot store in Beverly Hills, the quintessential French brand has been living the American dream this month. For their resort 2024 show, they stayed on the west coast to present a Venice-meets-Left Bank collection that relied less on stereotypical ""Hollywood"" aesthetics and more on capital-f Fun.   Guests including Marion Cotillard, Kristen Stewart, and Margaret Qualley were treated to a staging of epic proportions at Paramount Studios, one that gave a slight nod to Lagerfeld's penchant for dramatic, sweeping sets, yes, in Los Angeles, but also Cuba, China, and of course at the Grand Palais. A typical movie set lot was transformed into a massive roller rink, replete with double Cs and a scoreboard that had a running list of the models, almost announcing them like players on a starting lineup.   Since taking the creative reins in 2019, Virginie Viard has softened the Chanel woman and  embraced femininity. She upped the ante for this show, maybe taking inspiration from Karl's dramatic flair, but definitely taking cues from the laid-back, over-saturated energy of LA in the 70s and 80s. Hair was blown out to epic proportions, harkening back to iconic 90s Chanel shows, and makeup was sun-kissed and minimal, as the Hollywood starlet only needs a swipe of blush and some sunscreen.   The show started out with nary a tweed suit in sight, but rather skin-tight, sexy as can be swimsuits styled to the nines with jewelry, leg-warmers, and sneakers, leaning unapologetically into the Jazzercise craze. Neon-bright prints, ombré metallics and pastels appeared on richly detailed tweeds, lurex bodysuits, and casual shorts fit for lazy beach day. Breezy silks in solid colors were layered under miniskirts, and shiny tracksuits looked like something Jamie Lee Curtis' character in Perfect would have worn after teaching aerobics. The footwear even included block heeled sandals with light-up heels, making sure each girl had a personal spotlight. Every LA girl we know and love, from the Santa Monica skater girl to the Barbie-core Rodeo Drive princess, was present, with Viard casting her net from the PCH to Sunset Boulevard.   It felt like Viard was letting her hair down for the first time, stacking on shiny bangles and plenty of bags, and with them, a brand new attitude entered the room. The typical Hollywood golds and blacks didn't make their way into the collection til the very end, with a more mature ending of wrap dresses and embroidered tweed jumpsuits that didn't sacrifice glamour or camp. We can't help but wonder which saccharine pink and gold palette looks Margot Robbie might wear for her upcoming Barbie press tour. She's got quite the wardrobe to pick from.  "
elle,dior,Robert Pattinson Looks Chic In Tweed Skirt at Dior's Paris Fashion Week Show,"On Friday, January 20, Robert Pattinson was one of the highlights at Dior's Homme fall/winter 2023-2024 show during Paris Fashion Week. The Batman actor was looking very chic in brown and gray, with a fuzzy fleece-texture zipper jacket over a turtleneck in the same shade.  Underneath, he wore a pleated, navy tweed skirt that revealed his knee-high black boots. His hair looked almost wet, with soft curls falling over his forehead. Pattinson has worked with Dior for almost ten years, and is a Dior fragrance ambassador, working with the fashion house as they relaunch Dior Homme Sport.  Pattinson has been in the entertainment industry for decades now, and has spoken openly about how there is a very restrictive standard for men's bodies in his field. He told ES Magazine in an interview published the day before the Dior show that these ideas about men's physicality can get to anyone, adding, ""Yeah, it's crazy. Even if you're just watching your calorie intake, it's extraordinarily addictive. And you don't quite realize how insidious it is until it's too late.""  It is particularly disturbing to him how this trend influences the perception of young boys about their bodies and their relationship to exercise and eating. The actor claimed, however, that he is comfortable with his own body image, but has ""tried every fad you can think of, everything except consistency.""  He continued, ""I once ate nothing but potatoes for two weeks, as a detox. Just boiled potatoes and Himalayan pink salt. Apparently, it's a cleanse...And I tried to do keto once. I was like, ‘Oh, there's a diet where you just eat charcuterie boards and cheese all the time?' But I didn't realize you can't have beer as it completely defeats the purpose.""  "
elle,dior,Dior Beauty's Eyeliner Has A Playlist,"Not all eyeliner looks are worthy of a soundtrack, but Dior has one for you. Cue up Edith Piaf's Non Je Ne Regrette Rien, some songs of moody French chanteuse Juliette Gréco, and you'll be inspired to try an eyeliner look that's melancholic, strong, defiant, and a little bit punk. (Maybe Lana del Ray's Sad Girl would fit in here too).  At the Dior FW23 show, models wore black eyeliner and even more black eyeliner. It was blurrily smudged into the inner and outer corners of the eye and purposely exaggerated both above and below the lash line. ""It's like a deconstructed combination between a smokey eye and eyeliner,"" Peter Philips, Creative and Image Director for Dior Beauty.  Maybe a ""smoliner"" look, if you will. If you've never been able to fully master the gradation that comes with a flawless smoky eye or the perfection of a tight line, great news, because this look was neither of those things (there was also no contouring or highlight, so don't worry about those either).   Juxtaposed against the rich floral textiles, shine, and sculptural set that Portuguese artist Joana Vasconcelos created,  this season's beauty look was meant to stand out. ""We wanted to do a look where the girls don't disappear,"" Philips said. ""The idea was not to have a gorgeous smokey eye."" Or maybe you're thinking it's a little Wednesday Addams-core? ""It's melancholic 60's, Saint Germain, and there's a little sadness but also strongness."" The eyeliner (Dior Crayon Eyeliner Waterproof) was drawn and blended to go down a bit at the end of the eyes to create a moodier effect. For extra intensity, he used black eyeshadow (Dior 5 Couleurs Couture in Black Bow) and stamped additional color on it to make the look even blacker. No mascara (""It would look too sexy, almost, too sensual.""), a nude lip, and softly brushed brows rounded out the look. For a last touch -- models also degreased their T-zone, thanks to a bit of logomania. Philips showed off a book of sheets printed with ""Dior,"" the brand's blotting papers, giving a sneak peek into an upcoming new launch. Since public blotting is having a moment, thanks to Rihanna, these will surely have their TikTok moment in the future on your ""For You"" page.   To complete the full look, Guido Palau and his hair team then added low ponytails gathered at the nape of the neck, finished with thick black headbands with crinkled ribbons attached.  For added gleam and fullness, he blew hair away from the face using Oribe Thickening Spray and Oribe Supershine Light Moisturizing Cream.  "
elle,dior,Kim Jones Designed Sneakers for Hennessy—Even Though He Doesn't Drink,"Chances are, Kim Jones made your favorite sneakers—or at least, they would be your favorite, if they hadn't sold out in five seconds. He's the artistic director at Dior Men and the brains behind the ""Air Dior"" Nikes that literally broke the brand's website, plus collabs with Converse, those coveted skate slip-ons at Louis Vuitton, and that monogram pair with Supreme that's only available in limited stock on The RealReal. (If you're more into heels, don't panic. Mr. Jones is also in charge of Fendi's womenswear collection, where these stratospheric boots are currently going fast.)   Now, in an unlikely partnership, Jones is joining forces with Hennessy, the prestigious French cognac brand that's technically older than America. (It was founded in 1765, but alas, was never name-checked in Hamilton.) The main caveat? Although Hennessy X.O is an exquisite pour, Kim Jones doesn't drink. Ever. ""I'm really allergic!"" he laughs when I ask him if he did any sip-and-sketch rounds for his sneaker designs. ""I wanted to try it because I wanted to see why everyone was so obsessed by it, but you know, it just doesn't agree with me."" Instead, Jones used the classic brandy's rich brown color story. ""And since drinking Hennessy X.O is part of both formal and casual gatherings, it was really important for [the sneakers] to fit into any wardrobe in a different way."" Jones also created a decanter and bottle for the cognac, which is—surprise—owned by the same parent company as Dior itself.  When most people buy a bottle of Hennessy, they probably drink it (or at least gift it to someone special). But when they venture to buy a coveted Kim Jones sneaker, they might try and flip it for double the value instead. Is Jones cool with that? ""I've seen a lot of my friends' kids do that, actually! I think some of them have made loads of money,"" he laughs. ""But then they take that money and buy more sneakers, or other clothes they really want. To be honest, at that age, I didn't have that kind of ingenuity. So those guys? My hat's off to them.""   Ironically, instead of flipping streetwear in his youth, the 49-year-old designer served drinks ""at an opera house bar"" instead. ""I had to work to get through college, didn't I?"" he asks. ""But it was amazing, actually. You met opera singers, you met people that design sets, you met aristocracy, you met all sorts...but I did notice the people who ordered Hennessy always had really nice suits, watches, jewelry…I can't say I didn't think of them when I was creating these pieces."" One day at work, Jones served the Queen Mother. Two decades later, he was appointed an Officer of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II.  As a failed multitasker, I ask Jones how he keeps up with his two big day jobs—at two big-name fashion houses—along with various collabs (Tiffany & Co., Marc Jacobs, and BTS, to name a few), plus the normal stuff like eating, sleeping, and hanging out with Kate Moss. ""Oh, I can help you there,"" he starts, before adding, ""you just have to be incredibly organized."" Seriously? That's it?   ""And, okay, you need to be sure of what you're setting out to achieve. Where we start on the [Fendi] collection or where we start at [Dior], we know we're headed to an end product. And that end product is really how I've been imagining it to look all along. That goal never changes."" But Jones cautions that his singular focus can't happen alone. ""When you're working with a team that's already been at a brand for a while, you have to teach people what you want,"" he says. ""It takes time to work with an entity and a team of people. Trust, and time. And you have to be straightforward with people about that upfront. There's nothing wrong with saying, ‘This will be hard work, and we can't rush through it.' Everything good takes time."" Including Hennessy's new cognac, which takes an average of 45 years to mature.  Could abstaining from drinking be the secret to Jones' youthful glow? Even via Zoom, it looks like his complexion is powered by a ring light. Perhaps a skincare collaboration is in his future? ""I've been approached by most of the big beauty makers,"" he admits. We'll cheers to that, even if Jones won't.  "
elle,dior,Jisoo Gives a Behind-the-Scenes Look at Dior's Winter 2023 Show and Her Visit to the House's Archives,"Blackpink's Jisoo returned to Paris last month for Christian Dior's fall/winter 2023-2024 show, but she did more than just sit front row. The K-pop singer and house ambassador spent the day before the runway show learning more about Dior's history—and the women who most inspired Christian Dior, including his sister Catherine—during a private visit to the house's archives, known as Dior Heritage.   In the video above, shot by Melina Triana and Benjamin Vu and exclusively premiering on ELLE.com, Jisoo takes fans behind the scenes of her Paris visit and her intimate tour of the house's archives and history. ""I can't wait to see which archive pieces will be referenced by [Creative Director] Maria Grazia Chiuri in her collection,"" Jisoo said.  Jisoo, who has an older brother and sister, was particularly moved by the story of Catherine Dior, who inspired Miss Dior. ""The story of Christian Dior's younger sister Catherine was very emotional,"" Jisoo reflected, after learning her story and seeing photos of her. ""She had a tough life but the fact that she found the strength within to rebuild her life really impressed me. I'm excited to see Maria Grazia Chiuri's work inspired by Catherine Dior's story.""  ""One can believe Christian Dior was the main character of the house of Dior, but I got to learn that he actually had many exceptional women by his side,"" she continued. ""I was very moved hearing the stories of these characters who are not well-known.""  Jisoo learned that her favorite flower, lily of the valley, has important an significance to Dior, too. She was able to view a couple archival dresses that featured the flower in their print and design.   Of the show itself the next day, Jisoo gave a glowing review, saying, ""That was yet another spectacular collection by Maria Grazia Chiuri. The pieces inspired by the flower prints I saw yesterday in the archives were particularly fascinating. Once again, I loved this unforgettable experience with Dior. See you soon in Paris!""  Watch her full diary above, and look through intimate photos of her Dior Heritage visit, taken by Pierre Mouton, below: "
elle,versace,Gigi Hadid Climbed a Parking Garage for Versace,"""Versace is always the dream,"" says Dua Lipa. She is sitting on the roof of a parking garage in Los Angeles, surrounded by a thrumming crowd of fashion editors bleary from the Paris runways, stylists taking a break from their A-list clients for the upcoming Oscars, and K-Pop princes in popsicle-colored suits. Elton John zips by in a golf cart. The sun is about to set.  It's almost golden hour and go time for Versace's fall/winter 2023 show, which moved this season from Milan to Melrose Place, and harnessed the way everyone in Hollywood is chasing clout—fame, power, art, or even just sheer attention—while trying (or at least claiming) to stay grounded. If la-la land is merely an illusion, it's one with real stakes and true emotions lurking just beneath its glossy surface. Fashion straddles a similar line between fantasy and reality: it skips between our very real bodies and our very big imaginations. And because she's una specie di genia—that's ""kind of a genius"" in Italian—Donatella Versace has managed to make clothes for every girl, everywhere, all at once...even the girls who just live in our heads.  First, there was Gigi Hadid's opening look: a black power suit and slashed-pocket peplum that straddled the line between CEO and celebrity. (When it crossed Paris Hilton's field of vision, it became a living meme for ""get you a girl who can do both."") Croc-embossed miniskirts and tweed cocoon coats were firmly rooted in the reality of working women, while a few micro mini poufs (including one on Kendall Jenner) were part of the ""no pants, no problem"" trend and likely a revenge breakup post waiting to happen. In between were tons of options, both practical and dreamy—leather trenches, 3-D floral fabrics, goth-lite babydoll dresses—that towed Versace's assertively sexy party line, as in, ""You're wearing a Versace, you'd better go party.""  Like the California Dream itself, the show ended in a fantasy…and then again in a reality. The L.A. skyline became a purple haze, and Versace took her runway bow, wearing the same dress Emily Ratajkowski donned in the show. Prince's ""Let's Go Crazy"" blared through the speakers, and Anne Hathaway screamed every lyric in a glorious karaoke moment for the ages. Waiters circled with champagne and tiny pieces of avocado toast. Everyone took selfies, especially Tan France.  Next, the crowd of very famous stars realized they were on top of a parking garage at rush hour, and in mere seconds, transformed into impressively pragmatic people. Demi Moore led the charge to the elevators, Pamela Anderson navigated a steep staircase in pencil-thin stilettos (""I've been doing this a while!"" she laughed), and Miley Cyrus huddled with stylist Patti Wilson behind a valet station until the actual valet returned with their car. Cyrus' two-tone gown looked just as good in the ghastly fluorescent lighting—another nod to Signora Versace's skill at making glamour very real, even when surrounded by everyday grime.  Oh, one more thing: the Versace show was held on Barbie's birthday, and just a few miles up from her hometown of Malibu. There was no official tribute, but with eight bright pink looks on the catwalk and a series of satiny pink bags and shoes, it seems Barbiecore is definitively here to stay—at least until July, anyway, because that's when the movie comes out. Coincidentally or not, that's when these clothes do, too.  "
elle,versace,Give Anne Hathaway an Award For This Versace Look,"Anne Hathaway is back at it again, proving she's red carpet (in addition to Genovian, of course) royalty. At Versace's Fall/Winter 2023 show in Los Angeles, the actress delivered a killer all-black ensemble. The outfit: a Versace crocodile-effect minidress, sheer tights, sky-high platform boots and sunglasses, and sparkling Bulgari jewelry. The dominatrix-style set would do her Catwoman character proud.   Hathaway was joined by other big celebrities at the Versace show, including Lil Nas X, Miley Cyrus, Ariana DeBose, Elton John, and Dua Lipa.   Later that day, Hathaway stepped out in a different black dress (also Versace) for the Hollywood Beauty Awards. This one was long, slinky and gown-like. The dress had beautiful detailing, like gold buckle Versace Medusa straps. ""I'm at a point in my life now where I know having a first time at something remarkable like that—it's the only time it ever happens,"" Hathaway recently told ELLE. ""Being in a place where I could enjoy it felt like a really positive development.""  Hathaway has four feature films slated for release in 2023, including Mothers' Instinct alongside her friend Jessica Chastain. She also gained critical acclaim last year for her incredible performance as Rebekah Neumann in WeCrashed on Apple TV and Esther Graff in Armageddon Time. ""I have worked too hard on seeing myself with kinder eyes to give away my peace to those who haven't found it for themselves yet,"" Hathaway told ELLE. ""So I do my best to not be afraid of what others might say and just focus on enjoying my life."" "
elle,versace,Anne Hathaway Wore a Versace Dress With an Epic Leg Slit to the 2023 Met Gala,"Anne Hathaway might not have shown up to the Met Gala in Andy Sachs' Chanel boots, but she channeled Karl Lagerfeld in her own way—with the help of Donatella Versace, in fact. The Devil Wears Prada star looked breathtaking in a strapless safety pin dress by Versace, designed à la Lagerfeld with white tweed, pearl accents, and camellia flower details.   ""It was meant to be a marriage between Versace and Chanel,"" Hathaway, who is the new face of the Italian fashion house, said of her dress in a red carpet interview with Vogue. A pair of fingerless gloves, platform heels, and Bulgari jewels completed her look.   The ensemble was equal parts sophisticated and sexy, thanks to the safety pin cutouts and the major leg slit, which technically slices across the whole length of the gown. Hathaway even gave a quick tutorial for how to pose in the look during her livestream interview. ""There's just something about this dress that makes you kind of want to hit it,"" she said, popping out one hip and lifting her chin up high. ""Get a little Rosalía going on in your head and live in the fantasy.""  Hathaway credits her stylist, Erin Walsh, for collaborating with Versace on the look. ""I just do what Donatella tells me to do, very gratefully,"" the actress said. ""She sent me a sketch for this and I just went, ‘Well, alright!'""  The same attention to detail went into her beauty look for the night. She pointed out that her hairstylist, Orlando Pita, pinned a camellia from a Versace show in the '90s to her hair, completing her voluminous half-updo. From hair to heels, Hathaway's complete look is enough to wow Miranda Priestly herself. "
elle,versace,Dua Lipa Wore a String Bikini From Her Versace Collaboration—Her ‘Summer Outfit Until Further Notice',"Only Dua Lipa could make a bathroom look so gorgeous while flaunting her own designer collaboration. The singer took to Instagram to show off a polka dot string bikini adorned with butterflies from her and Donatella Versace's La Vacanza collection. ""My summer outfit until further notice 🦋🦋"" Lipa wrote. ""The cutest @versace polka dots bikini from my #VersaceLaVacanza collection with @donatella_versace.""  Versace commented on Lipa's post, sharing, ""An absolute BEAUTY!! This summer is ALL about La Vacanza @dualipa 🦋☀️✨""  Lipa and Versace first unveiled their collection last month. Lipa shared footage of the runway show on May 24, writing, ""Feeling overwhelmed with happiness and still taking in last night!

Bridgerton actress Simone Ashley gave Lipa a shout-out when speaking to ELLE.com at the Veuve Clicquot polo classic in New York City about who her fashion inspirations are.   ""I love Dua Lipa's collaboration with Donatella [Versace],"" Ashley said. ""It was really inspiring.""  Lipa has more projects this summer. The singer will be playing multiple mermaids in the Barbie film out next month. She also recorded the lead single for the soundtrack that she released in late May, ""Dance the Night Away.""

harper's bazar,louis vuitton,Louis Vuitton's Yayoi Kusama Collection Is Back for the First Time in a Decade,"Everything Yayoi Kusama does is infinite.  In 2006, the then-creative director of Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, met Kusama at her studio in Tokyo. The Japanese artist handed the designer a Vuitton Ellipse bag, hand-painted with her signature dots. Six years later, Jacobs would send similar bags down the runway, launching one of the brand's most popular artist collaborations to date.   Kusama's art—which typically features dots and mirrors—is inspired by repetition, eternity, and the illusion of a never-ending space. Her Vuitton collaboration is just as circular: Over a decade after its debut, it's back.   Today, Louis Vuitton launched the first part of its second collaboration with the artist. There are still dots (appearing on bags as hyper-realistic wet paint dabs, inspired by a Louis Vuitton trunk hand-painted by Kusama in 2012), as well as metallic studs meant to mimic the metallic orbs of Kusama's Narcissus Garden and the famous Infinity Rooms you've seen on your Instagram feed. The collection, which features over 450 pieces, isn't just bags. There's also dotted jeans, spotted Archlight sneakers, and metallized leather jackets—plus menswear, fragrances, and eyewear. The second drop will focus more on Kusama's pumpkin motif and become available in March.   Kusama has remarked that the original Vuitton collection was designed to embody the concept of ""Love Forever."" In response, Marc Jacobs noted, ""Love is a beautiful idea. The dots represent something that has no points, no hard edges and is infinite. And what could be nicer than infinite love?"" The collection was indeed released to much love from fans, and it remains loved on resale sites.   So far, Nicolas Ghesquière's take is equally well-liked—literally. Campaign images featuring Gisele Bündchen, Anok Yai, and Fei Fei Sun garnered over 1 million likes on the fashion house's instagram last month, which is nearly forty times more the average engagement per post.  Then again, this is also the first time a Louis Vuitton Yayoi Kusama collection has debuted on Instagram. Back in 2012, Louis Vuitton didn't even have an account. Still, the original Yayoi Kusama collection was Instagramable before anyone knew what that meant.  The collection and the pop-up spaces selling it—like the one in New York's Meatpacking district, with the entire store covered in floor-to-ceiling infinity dots and lined with extra-large metallic orbs—are clearly built for the social media era. Whether the response will be the same as it was ten years ago has yet to be determined, but with a new generation increasingly obsessed with archival fashion and collections of the past, the stage is set for success and plenty of TikToks.   Currently on the social media platform, Louis Vuitton's 2002 Murakami collection, emblematic of peak Y2K fashion, has Gen Z's attention. Kusama's dots, though, represent an entirely different style era defined by bow headbands and the kind of outfits Zoey Deschanel would wear in 500 Days of Summer—not necessarily the ones you'd see Paris Hilton wearing out to a club in 2004. But maybe 2023 will finally be the year whimsical 2010s fashion really does make a comeback. Fashion is as cyclical as Kusama's dots, after all.   You can shop the first drop of the new Louis Vuitton Yayoi Kusama collection here.  "
harper's bazar,louis vuitton,Pharrell Williams Is the New Men's Creative Director of Louis Vuitton,"The position of men's creative director at Louis Vuitton has remained empty since the death of Virgil Abloh in 2021. Today, the house announced that his successor will be celebrity producer Pharrell Williams. His first collection will show this June during the Men's Fashion week in Paris.The highly awaited appointment comes as a surprise to many, given that the names of designers like Grace Wales Bonner, Martine Rose, and Telfar Clemens have been swirling for months. It's one of Pietro Beccari's first big moves as the new Louis Vuitton Chairman and CEO, a position he took just two weeks ago.   In a statement, Beccari described William's appointment as a return, rather than a brand-new start: ""I am glad to welcome Pharrell back home, after our collaborations in 2004 and 2008 for Louis Vuitton, as our new Men's Creative Director. His creative vision beyond fashion will undoubtedly lead Louis Vuitton towards a new and very exciting chapter. ""  Pharrell's name has become somewhat synonymous with luxury collaborations, but his sunglasses collection with then-Louis Vuitton Creative Director Marc Jacobs in 2004 was his very first. Long time friend Abloh re-issued the colorful collection with gold details in 2018, with pairs originally retailing for $300 to $500 and then upwards of $1,700 for resale. When the shades originally dropped, Pharrell told Women's Wear Daily, ""You have to understand, I am just a regular dude. At the end of the day, this is all an incredible dream come true."" He then added, ""He is Marc Jacobs and it is Louis Vuitton, and who am I for that matter?""   Pharrell has since gone on to collaborate with Chanel and Moncler. His long-term partnership at Adidas Originals began in 2014, with his original collection featuring makeups of classic styles like the Adidas Superstar, the Stan Smith, and the brand's track jacket. Just this past November, after years of the internet making jokes about his ageless complexion (at one point, he had to publicly tell Time Out London, ""I am not [a vampire]""), he launched his skincare line, Humanrace.   He's also a fashion fan favorite, winning the CFDA fashion icon award in 2015, and his impact on style as we know it can't be understated. As the frontman of the hip-hop and rock band N.E.R.D, he shifted people's perception of what hip-hop style could be by incorporating skatewear, bold prints, and even nerdy prep classics in his look.   In 2020, Abloh told the The New York Times that Pharrell's arrival on the scene with the 2001 album 'In Search Of...' had a lasting influence on him, ""As a kid growing up in the suburbs of Chicago, skateboarding and finding my own identity, it resonated with me more than hip-hop on its own. [It said] that it was fine to be in between. And I think that has described a whole generation of young black kids and artists who have since been determined to be themselves and jump through that door that was opened by Pharrell.""   Many also consider Pharrell a pioneer of the gender-neutral clothing moment. He appeared on the cover of GQ in 2019 wearing a ballgown puffer, was the first man to star in a Chanel ad in 2017, and owns a truly envy-inducing number of pieces from Phoebe Philo's time at Céline.  Pharrell is no stranger to LVMH, the French luxury conglomerate that owns Vuitton. The Japanese producer and designer Nigo, with whom Pharrell launched the influential Billionaire Boys Club, was appointed the creative director of LVMH brand Kenzo in 2021. And Pharrell was a part of the re-brand of Tiffany, starring in campaigns after Beyoncé and Jay-Z. He recently wore a custom pair of almond-shaped emerald and diamond encrusted Tiffany sunglasses to the Grammys, and hinted to WWD that more projects were ""in the works.""     LVMH's priorities appear to be shifting, with an emphasis on creating major pop culture moments. Pharrell's influence has actually already made a viral hit for Louis Vuitton indirectly. The most recent men's show featured Spanish flamenco pop sensation Rosalía playing songs from her record-breaking album Motomami, which was produced in part by Pharrell. Her performance blew up, earning millions of views, likes, and comments on TikTok. Some critics have complained that there were more videos of the moment than of the actual clothing, but maybe that was the point: Everyone was talking about the show for days after models walked down the runway.  As of this morning, Pharrell has wiped his Instagram clean. The appointment announcement from Louis Vuitton is the only post on his page. And if one thing is clear, it's this: We're entering a new era, for both the artist and the brand. "
harper's bazar,louis vuitton,Rihanna's Baby Bump Makes Its High-Fashion Debut in Louis Vuitton Campaign,"Who else would star in Pharrell Williams's first-ever campaign as Louis Vuitton's menswear creative director but Rihanna and her baby bump?  The powerhouse duo dropped their blockbuster advertisement yesterday, which features Rihanna on a stylish coffee run while toting a rainbow stack of bags covered in the house's signature logo motifs. In the campaign, the singer wears a multitoned gray and pixelated leather button-up, which is mostly left unbuttoned, exposing her baby bump underneath. She also wears black trousers, layers of necklaces, and a glittering earring cuff.  Williams announced the mega collaboration by sharing a photo of himself posing in front of one of the billboards, blown up outside the Musée d'Orsay in Paris. In the snap, he wears a black leather biker jacket, baggy black pants, and yellow reflective sunglasses.  The campaign was released just a few days before the kickoff of Men's Fashion Week in Paris, which will be Williams's first since he was appointed as Louis Vuitton's menswear creative director in February. Williams succeeds Virgil Abloh, who held the role until his death in November 2021.  Of the musician's takeover of the house's menswear line, Louis Vuitton chairman and CEO Pietro Beccari previously said in a statement, ""I am glad to welcome Pharrell back home, after our collaborations in 2004 and 2008 for Louis Vuitton, as our new Men's Creative Director. His creative vision beyond fashion will undoubtedly lead Louis Vuitton towards a new and very exciting chapter.""  Meanwhile, Rihanna is pregnant with her and boyfriend A$AP Rocky's second child. She publicly announced the news during her historic Super Bowl halftime show performance this past February, and has since continued to dole out inimitable and innovative maternity looks—including fur coats, lace-up heels, and plenty of midriff-baring tops—so it comes as no surprise that Williams chose her to make a statement for his first Louis Vuitton campaign. "
harper's bazar,louis vuitton,Pharrell Delivers a True Pop Culture Moment at Louis Vuitton,"The livestream of Pharrell Williams's debut show for Louis Vuitton began with Pupil King, a short film by Todd Tourso. Sitting on a bench along the River Seine in Paris, wearing a black knit vest and a brown LV monogram leather cap, comedian Jerrod Carmichael asks artist Henry Taylor, ""Do you admit to yourself how bad you want it?""  Carmichael slams the back of his hand against his palm. ""Sometimes I don't say, like, truly how badly I want it.""   ""Actions speak louder than words,"" says Taylor, apologizing for the cliché. Shortly after that, models began to descend from the illuminated Pont Neuf, the oldest standing bridge crossing the river.   Williams has not said much since being named creative director for menswear by Louis Vuitton in February, a position that had remained vacant since 41-year-old Virgil Abloh's unexpected passing in November 2021. Instead, much was said of Williams. Online, fashion fans and music fans duked it out over whether a famous hip-hop multi-hyphenate made sense in one of the top design jobs in the industry. But everyone could agree the hiring indicated a shift of Louis Vuitton's focus, one that placed culture at the center.   Leading up to the show, Pietro Beccari, who was appointed CEO of the house in January, told The New York Times, ""It was important that we found someone having a broader spectrum than being a very fantastic designer, which is great for the industry and we have many of them."" Later on in the piece, Williams would go on to mention that he has no delusions about who he is and what he is capable of: ""I am a creative designer from the perspective of the consumer. I didn't go to Central Saint Martins. But I definitely went to the stores and purchased, and I know what I like.""  His first designs for the house fit this framework. Covered in the brand's signature prints and monograms, they telegraphed Louis Vuitton from a distance. But they were also imbued with a sense of impenitent joy that was paramount to the show. A handful of the first models wore tailored suits with matching shorts, a look Williams has become personally associated with on the red carpet. Others wore rain boots and carried mini trunks covered in a digitized version of Vuitton's Damier check pattern, the original of which was reimagined in jacquard and pearl embroidery throughout. The classic Speedy bag was revived in bright primary colors and dangled along long legs ending in chunky socks and lug-soled T-strap Mary Janes.   They are the kind of pieces a customer might save up for to prove to themselves and those around them that they've made it. They are bold, like the types of looks our favorite artists pull together to stand out on the red carpet. They are why ""quiet luxury"" can only ever go so far—because the pleasures of perceived opulence are far more relatable, whether anyone cares to admit it or not.   Williams is considered one of the best-dressed men in music, and his own personal style clearly served as inspiration for a handful of looks, perhaps none more obvious than that worn by former Saint Laurent creative director Stefano Pilati. Pilati's glasses were lined in pearls that framed his eyes, his tailored jacket embroidered in pearl Damier and styled with pleated wool shorts. While being self-referential can be perceived as egotistical, it doesn't feel that way when Williams does it. There's an undeniable earnestness to it, as if he's telling us: I know you want to dress like your favorite artist—and that's fine!   It's why a couple of days before his debut, he rolled out an ad campaign starring Rihanna in an unbuttoned leather button-down with her pregnant belly exposed and colorful green, yellow and red Speedy bags nestled in the crooks of her elbows. Her name trended for days after, indicating a true cultural moment—which is exactly what Williams seems to be promising to give the brand. There are plenty of designers creating works of art that reflect our reality, or gorgeous shapes that consumers want to feel on their bodies, but there aren't many who have been able to deliver these kinds of pop culture escapes. It's why today's youth are enamored with the red carpet of the early 2000s. It represents something unserious and fun: glamour without complications.  Recent Louis Vuitton designers, particularly Marc Jacobs and Abloh, have a history of providing fashion fit for the moment. Throughout his collection, Williams nodded to their work, including Jacobs's top-handle Alma bag silhouettes, which became paparazzi photo staples in the Aughts.  He created his digital camouflage print as an homage to a 2019 pixelated pattern first introduced by Abloh. And he  introduced a bit of himself, with an LVERS emblem on varsity jackets that references the ""Virginia Is for Lovers"" slogan of his home state. The bold Speedys were meant to evoke dupe culture—picture fake bags in colors you know a house doesn't produce lining the sidewalk of Canal Street. While Williams brings plenty of star power—Zendaya, Beyoncé, and Jay-Z were in the front row in Paris—there was also a sense that he wants his Louis Vuitton to be for everyone, old fans of the brand and new.  Williams also just seemed to want to have fun, with a choir at the end of the runway creating a celebratory tone. When he came out to take his bow, he brought his entire design team with him.  He spent more than five minutes on the runway, soaking in the moment with a genuine exuberance that's rare in the fashion industry. It's clear he'd been dreaming of this moment, and he wasn't afraid to show how badly he wanted it.  "

The 18-year-old daughter of Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin made her Fashion Week debut today at the Chanel haute couture spring/summer 2023 show in Paris. Apple wore a black-and-white iteration of the house's signature tweed skirt-and-jacket set, which she paired with a black quilted cross-body bag and black platform loafers.  As for glam, Apple seemed to channel the '60s mod girl. She wore a fully lined eye in black and kept her layered blonde hair down with a subtle flip at the ends.  Fashion journalist Derek Blasberg commented on Apple's now viral Chanel appearance on Twitter.  ""Karl Lagerfeld met Apple Martin when she was 4 years old and declared that one day she'd be a Chanel girl,"" he wrote, captioning behind-the-scenes photos of Apple at the show. ""It happened today!""  For some fans, Apple's appearance might bear a striking resemblance to her mom, from their tall statures to their near-identical smizes. (To compare, see a photo of the Shakespeare in Love actress from the '90s below.)  Paltrow is known for singing her daughter's praises on social media. Last year, the Goop mogul even dedicated an International Women's Day tribute to the teen.  ""I've been spending the morning thinking about all of the incredible women I love, who love me back hard. I keep thinking about the women I have known since kindergarten or 7th grade, who are more strongly in my life than almost ever. But today I want to pay tribute to one (technically almost) woman on the cusp of it,"" she wrote, captioning a screenshot of the two on FaceTime together. ""This woman gives me hope for the future of sisterhood, and for the future of our planet. And this woman has made me the woman I am today more than anyone else."" "
harper's bazar,chanel,Kristen Stewart Looked Like a Doll in a White Ruffled Chanel Gown in Berlin,"Kristen Stewart is back on her Chanel style streak.  Today, the actress arrived at the Berlin International Film Festival in a princess-like gown from the French fashion house's spring/summer 2023 couture collection. The white dress featured a billowing skirt with layers of ruffles, a white bodice embroidered with designs of flora and fauna, and a gray built-in belt covered in white flowers that extended to the shoulder straps.   Stewart styled the gown with a diamond choker necklace with a pretty bow at the front, and glossy white-and-black boots. She gave the ultra-feminine look an edge with dark brows and deep red eye shadow.   While on the red carpet, the Twilight star posed like a ballerina, with her hands in front of her.  The 73rd Berlin International Film Festival is taking place at the Berlinale Palast starting today, February 16, and ending on February 26.  Stewart has been a face of Chanel for some time now.   Last May, she supported the brand at its cruise 2023 show in Monte Carlo, Monaco, alongside fellow fashion house darlings Vanessa Paradis and Tilda Swinton. For the occasion, Stewart looked like a chic party girl in a black-and-white sequined minidress with maroon and navy stripes. She paired the piece with sheer black tights and matching platform open-toe heels. Her hair was pulled back into a high ponytail, and she went for a rosy, smoky-eyed beauty look. The Spencer star's only jewelry was her engagement ring from her fiancée, Dylan Meyer.  She also wore a Chanel look to the 2022 Oscars in March. The outfit consisted of a tuxedo jacket and itty-bitty hot pants—custom-made for her by Chanel. ""It's gonna be groundbreaking,"" Tara Swennen, her stylist of 17 years, told Harper's BAZAAR before the ceremony of the unexpected yet deliciously sophisticated look. ""Definitely one of the first of its kind!"" "
harper's bazar,chanel,"Ladies and Gentlemen, H.E.R.'s First Chanel Show","Singer-songwriter H.E.R has accomplished a lifetime of major firsts at just 25 years old. Predicting she'll EGOT one day hardly feels like a stretch—she's already won five Grammys and an Oscar for Best Original Song in 2021. She's also checking off a fashion bucket list outside the recording studio, starting with attending her first Chanel show yesterday at Paris Fashion Week.  On the phone after taking in Chanel's camellia-embellished fall 2023 collection, H.E.R. told me that a Chanel invite represented a different kind of career milestone than her bevy of gold statues. She and her stylist, Wouri Vice, had spent the early days of her career ""just trying to figure it out"" and cutting up sweatsuits. ""There weren't that many brands in the beginning who looked out or supported,"" she reflects, ""and we didn't have that many options, the budgets were different.""   Attending Chanel all these years later, ""it's really just a testament to my journey and what we've accomplished and just what we've been proud to represent—it's just really, really special and it's crazy how life works,"" she says.  Chanel's latest collection was its own reflection on a first and a house code. Creative director Virginie  Viard designed an ode to the camellia, a flower that first embellished a Chanel dress in 1923 and has reliably bloomed in collections ever since. Models circled gigantic 3-D flowers that levitated over an otherwise minimal runway. Camellias reappeared across the looks clipped into models' hair, printed on dresses, and in their full form as a novelty bag with a chain handle. H.E.R. absorbed every second. ""I'm not gonna lie—I was really pleasantly surprised,"" she says. ""I think of a certain thing when I think of Chanel, but I feel a lot of the pieces were a twist on the classics."" Favorite moments from the collection spoke to her on a piece-by-piece level, including a pink boot with a black cap toe and a wide-leg jumpsuit.  The outfit H.E.R. chose to take it all in felt like its own twist on the materials and motifs that make Chanel, Chanel. She wore a slouchy coordinating cashmere and mohair sweater and wide-leg pants from Chanel's 2022/2023 Métiers d'Art collection, with a red flap bag, red platform heels, a Coco Crush ring, and Chanel fine jewelry.   ""It's very much ‘70s rock star, which I reference a lot,"" H.E.R. explained. ""I look at Hendrix or Janis Joplin or Sly Stone and that's usually my inspo. Immediately, this look kind of screamed that."" Adding sunglasses, strands of chunky necklaces, and wavy curls for show day, the whole outfit just ""clicked.""   ""Easy,"" ""cozy,"" and ""chill"" are words I notice H.E.R. using to describe her outfit and the atmosphere at the show itself. Forget any preconceived notions about a buttoned-up Paris runway. Ephemeral energy is hard to translate into words, but this is how H.E.R. captured the mood: ""It was very balanced, very elegant, very classy. Everybody is like, just honored to be there. You know? That's at least how I felt.  Nobody's like, trying anything. They're just happy to be there and just want to appreciate the clothes and appreciate the show.""  ""Everyone"" includes Zoe Saldana (""She kind of came up to me, which was really nice. We had been on a plane together one time so we were laughing about that"") and FKA Twigs (""Who I love, and we got to chop it up a little bit""). And, most notably to H.E.R., the models.   ""I really want to commend Chanel for the representation of all of these models that come from different backgrounds, different sizes, different skin tones, all different hair styles— it was such a diverse group,"" she says. ""I thought that was really, really exciting to see and also added to the vibe of the room.""  ""Nothing felt intimidating,"" H.E.R. summarizes. ""Even though it is Chanel, it was very warm for me, and that's what I really loved about it."" All the makings of another memorable first.  "
harper's bazar,chanel,Penélope Cruz's Playful Take on the Classic Tweed Dress Includes Feathers,"If you think dressing up in tweed is boring, allow Penélope Cruz to prove you wrong.  The Academy Award-winning actress made a dazzling appearance to sit front row at Chanel's fall/winter 2023–24 runway show during Paris Fashion Week. As an ambassador of the iconic French luxury house, Cruz wore its signature tweed—with a playful twist.  Her tweed blazer dress embraced a feminine silhouette, with its deep V-neckline and flared miniskirt. Wispy white feathers tinged at the ends with hot pink or canary yellow adorned the bottom half of the dress, adding a colorful dimension to the navy blue piece. Other details included silver bejeweled buttons and a ruched black belt with a silver crystal buckle.  Cruz let the statement dress shine by keeping the rest of her ensemble to a classic black color palette, carrying a quilted Chanel purse with a gold chain strap and wearing glossy pumps.  The actress is known for making fashion statements while clad in Chanel.   For instance, she attended last year's Tribeca Film Festival wearing a glistening one-shoulder evening gown from the brand. Sparkling black sequins covered the dress, and she further accessorized with the house's iconic quilted clutch, peep-toe heels, and a gold-and-diamond choker interwoven with black leather featuring Chanel's double-C logo.   On another occasion during the cinema festival, Cruz wore a hot pink Chanel look, consisting of a floor-length slipdress emblazoned with a square geometric pattern and a hot pink quilted box bag to match.

harper's bazar,dior,Dior's Reformulated Capture Totale Le Sérum Just Got Even Better,"When I got word that Dior was planning on reformulating the iconic Capture Totale serum, I was skeptical. Tinkering with beloved formulas is tricky business. Can a serum that's already deemed great truly get even better? The answer is a resounding yes. The new Capture Totale Le Sérum, $100, should earn a top spot on your 2023 vanity for its reputation of firming, smoothing, and plumping.  ""Firmness is the new wrinkle,"" Virginie Couturaud, Parfums Christian Dior scientific communication director, tells BAZAAR.com. ""With this serum, we act on the epidermis level, because we can protect the skin. If you maintain the quality of your epidermis, then you decrease the signs of aging on your dermis.""  Though the improved Le Sérum launched a few days ago, it's been a staple in my routine for the last two months. I got my hands on the updated formula back in November during a visit to the LVMH lab in Orléans, France, where I received a crash course in the science and technology that make this new serum worth it.   There's major science packed into this bottle that we'll get into in a second. The Dior Capture Totale Le Sérum addresses skin's firmness first, as well as other signs of aging like loss of radiance, elasticity, and uneven texture. Though wrinkles and loss of elasticity aren't major concerns for me, I do notice my skin appearing brighter and more radiant after using the serum, and these changes have only continued to improve with each application. Another aspect of the reformulation that I love is the improved product texture. This version absorbs so much more readily and doesn't leave skin feeling tacky.  Three key ingredients have been combined in Le Sérum: Longoza and Iris extracts, and a newly developed active ingredient called hyaluronic poly-filler. The latter was inspired by injectable fillers and lends an immediate resurfacing and plumping effect. The fermented Longoza extract is cultivated from the Dior Garden in Madagascar and works to firm skin, while Tuscan Iris extracts from Dior's Garden in Tuscany, Italy, help maintain skin's radiance by forming a surface shield against damaging UVA rays.   Everyone's skin has stem cells that play a role in the aging process, regardless of the type or tone. This is where the Longoza, nicknamed the phoenix flower, really shines. Here's the nerdy part: The fermented extract directly targets skin's mother cells to reverse the effects of aging by converting beta-cells (the aging ones) back into alpha-cells (the young ones) by re-anchoring them to the dermo-epidermal junction (the mechanism that supports the epidermis, or the outer layer of skin). This conversion gives the stem cells the capability to renew. The ability for your epidermis to remain firm and plump depends on the capacity of these mother cells to remain anchored. All this from just one pump of a bottle.  Dior took testing of this serum one step further to ensure it was truly beneficial for all skin tones. Since its development in the late 1970s, the Fitzpatrick scale has been the go-to system of classification for skin in dermatology and the beauty industry. But a system composed of only six shades of skin (lightest being one and darkest being six) doesn't accurately illustrate the many colors present in the world.   So when it came time to test the new Capture Totale, LVMH funded an initiative that brought together their R&D scientists and specialized testing centers to create its new T.O.T.A.L. skin-testing platform. With the 110 colors of the PANTONE SkinTone guide (versus the six color grades of the Fitzpatrick classification), Dior is the first LVMH brand to use this new platform to measure the effectiveness of its reformulated Capture Totale Le Sérum. This pioneering system of classification is the most comprehensive skin-testing platform to date.   The Dior Capture Totale Le Sérum is available now online at dior.com. "
harper's bazar,dior,Dior Collaborates with Artist Mickalene Thomas,"At Dior, couture craftsmanship goes beyond the clothes. Over the past few years, Dior artistic director Maria Grazia Chiuri has transformed her biannual couture shows into a platform for creative conversations with artists, featuring stunning handmade sets that are also art installations, consistently created in celebration of feminist artists and craftsmanship. Her list of collaborators includes some of the biggest names in contemporary art including Judy Chicago, Eva Jospin, Madhvi and Manu Parekh, Penny Slinger, and, this season, Mickalene Thomas, the American visual artist best known for her rhinestone-embellished figurative paintings and collages that celebrate Black and queer subjects ensconced in imagery drawn from the popular art canon.  Several of the projects, including Thomas's, comprise enormous tapestries and have been realized with the help of the dab hands at Mumbai's Chanakya ateliers and Chanakya School of Craft.  Pioneering African American singer and dancer Josephine Baker served as Chiuri's muse this season, informing the collection's stage-worthy silk and velvet dresses decorated with fringing, delicate embroidery, and tiny silver studs and sequins. But she handed the scenography over to Thomas, who created 13 photo collages of a new pantheon of women who inspire her, which lined the walls around the runway.  ""The inspiration for the creative process developed through conversation about the importance of Black female role models that broke racial barriers by going against the grain and creating a new platform for many others,"" Thomas says.   Thomas used archival images to create the colleges of Baker and 12 other pathbreaking performing artists, models, and activists from the course of the 20th century: singers Eartha Kitt and Nina Simone; supermodels Donyale Luna, Naomi Sims, Ophelia DeVore, and Helen Williams; actresses Dorothy Dandridge, Diahann Carroll, Marpessa Dawn, Lena Horne, and Josephine Premice; and jazz pianist Hazel Scott, the first African American woman to have her own television show.  ""In choosing these thirteen phenomenal Black women, across continents, the consideration was to research a diverse and eclectic group of women with the odds set against them,"" Thomas says. ""In spaces that attempted to reject or impede their success, they persevered with confidence, elegance, beauty and talent.""  The compositions—which recall an earlier series Thomas made using collaged photos and found film footage from the film The Color Purple—were generated using digital processes from photos of the women she found online. Thomas stacked and distorted individual photos and overlaid them on pixelated grid, using a soft jewel tone color palette that takes cues from the traditional CMYK printing processes. The collages were then digitally printed at cinematic scale on a textile base and elaborated with embroidery, including Thomas's signature sparkle, by Chanakya artisans.  Thomas's use of the Chanakya ateliers to help finish her pieces is a testament to Chiuri's commitment to using craft to build bridges between global communities. Chiuri, who has long worked with with Chanakya artisans on ready-to-wear pieces, first enlisted their assistance for couture for Spring 2020, when she and Chicago commissioned 22 immense hand embroidered panels that lined a womb-like runway and posed questions like, ""What if women ruled the world?"" and ""Would there be equal parenting?"" For Fall 2021, Chanakya artisans created a nearly 400 yard tapestry featuring complex threads of interweaving trees designed by French installation artist Jospin. And for Spring 2022, the Chanakya artisans embroidered another set of 22 tapestries, this time transposing some of the Indian artist couple the Parekhs' paintings inspired by Hindu goddesses and regional folk-art forms onto cloth. Each one of these panels took an astounding 500 to 2,800 hours to create.  This project marks the third time that Chiuri and Thomas have worked together: on a mixed media Lady Dior Art bag in 2019, and on an interpretation of the New Look for the Resort 2020 collection, which was a Bar jacket featuring one of Thomas's collages in beading.  ""Fashion certainly has become a fusion of many different mediums—it's sculpture and textiles and movement all in one,"" Thomas says. ""The experience of creating for this show was a combination of the many art forms at Dior's couture atelier and my own collage work with the meticulous embroidery work of the Chanakya School of Craft and the photography of each of the portraits featured throughout the installation. The result was an immersive experience and union of creativity.""   This story has been updated. "
harper's bazar,dior,Paris Couture: Should Designers Roar or Whisper?,"Yesterday, I awoke to two text messages sharing the same image, of model Irina Shayk, wearing a black column dress with a lifesize lion head in mid-roar affixed to the bodice in the Schiaparelli Spring 2023 show that opened Paris Couture Week. One text read, ""LOVE!!! SLAY!!!"" The other? ""This is the most""—uh, well, it got somewhat unprintable from there, but let's just say, it wasn't pleasant.  The Schiaparelli animal head looks—Shalom Harlow as a snow leopard, Shayk as a lion, and Naomi Campbell in a wolf coat, inspired respectively by their symbolism as lust, pride, and avarice in Dante's Divine comedy—set off a firestorm online, which my colleague Tara Gonzalez wrote about here. When it became apparent that they were fake—made of resin, wool, silk, and foam—some corners of the internet got even more upset.   Rarely is fashion so divisive; usually everyone either loves a collection, or ignores it. To see something cause such a fracas—one Instagram commenter suggested the house should burn the entire collection in shame, and PETA actually issued a message in support of the looks—is testament to designer Daniel Roseberry's outrageous creativity.   I suppose they were a little silly. But I could also see the dresses as a gleefully grotesque commentary on our dubious assertion that faux fur is better than real. It's like the Impossible Burger of couture: is it better to eat a biologically ""ethical"" mockup of the real thing, or a beautifully prepared vegetable? Or you could see it as commentary on the way the ultra-wealthy hunt for fashion like sport. The pieces lend themselves to bizarre intellectual play, which is a worthy goal for dressmaking at the highest artistic level, don't you think?   Everyone pines for the outrageous clothes of McQueen, of Mugler, of Dior-era Galliano; and yet they often forget that those clothes, today, would be very controversial. (Or pointless. See: Coperni's spray-on dress.)   Schiap herself used exotic skins and furs in her collections; one of her most famous designs was a monkey fur coat, which she even produced as ready-to-wear. Roseberry's heads felt like a nod to that, with the added gloss of Schiap's Surrealist obsession (in the show notes, he wrote about his desire to trick us into thinking they might be real heads). But I don't think they're important merely because they're provocative, in a Jordan Wolfson kind of way. It's more that Roseberry uses fashion to elicit feelings and thoughts we don't typically associate with the medium. He reminds us that clothes can be funny, and disturbing, and frightening, and weird. In his show notes, Roseberry called the collection ""my homage to doubt."" Not everyone can pull off his clothes, or even wants to, and I love how comfortable he is with that. Lean into the niche! It's couture, and 2023, after all! If anything, his weird stuff is a refuge for decadents who feel put off by the mainstream of fashion but still feel that urge for something unusual, special, sumptuous. For all the ""who's gonna wear this???"" head-shaking that his clothes can elicit, they have a strong and dedicated clientele (his ready-to-wear salon at Bergdorf Goodman is always happily peopled), and celebrities are willing to sit under the hands of Pat McGrath for five hours to get crystals applied to their bodies (as Doja Cat did) in the name of Schiap.   Let's turn our attention to the rest of the collection, where Roseberry did some other great stuff. (In fact, I sort of wish Roseberry had just done the Shayk tiger look, which was the most interesting and Schiap-esque, like a bored second wife rolled herself up in the library's tiger head rug and wandered into her husband's bridge game.) This collection was more refined than season past—simplified and clarified. The opening look was an hourglass white jacket, almost a Bar shape though a bit more curvaceous and Victorian and therefore perverted, made of beads or paper or bundled silk, with a pair of black cropped trousers. Hedonistic, but clean. The other standout looks were Oscar-worthy, which is always a big part of this season of couture: a rounded velvet bodice with a skirt of satin pinched in the front, and a velvet jumpsuit with enormous shoulders and ombre sleeves, and a black column dressing with an enormous spray of hay-gold loopy passementerie down the front.   If Schiaparelli yells, Dior whispers. Maria Grazia Chiuri's Dior collection was inspired by Josephine Baker, but with a light hand. I'm intrigued by the way that designers, especially women, seem to be reinterpreting the 1920s, which is the first moment (and many historians would argue, the only period) when fashion was truly modern, invested in newness and technology and keeping pace with the progress and speed of the rest of culture. Emily Adams Bode Aujla explored a similar theme in her womenswear debut this past weekend, but Maria Grazia was even more restrained and less fantastical, concentrating on a beautiful and understated selection of pleating and quilting techniques on silk crepe skirts and separates. Even when she went ""J'ai Deux Amours,"" which is to saying making more obvious homages to Baker, the clothes looked elemental, almost like the technical skin or foundation beneath the 1920s' de rigeur slippery silk dress, as in a see-through chainmail-and-bead top and skirt, and a gold and silver-striped tank dress with fringey beads at the hem.   But really, this is a collection to zoooom in on, so you can appreciate the draped neck and the delicate pleating of a black bateau neck shell top and skirt, or the sparkling beadwork of a fringe top and crushed silk skirt. Of course, the most sublime thing about these clothes is that their technique and impact will never be truly obvious to anyone except the woman wearing them. To others, they might look subtle, and it could take a few minutes to appreciate the complex pleating technique of a shell white tennis dress. But talk to women who have worn Chiuri's clothes and they rave about the fit, the practicality, the durability. Her emphasis on practical daywear in this collection, mixed with gowns that have an artisanal, un-corporate glow, feel like a peek into the beautifully appointed home of a woman fabulous beyond our imagination. Privacy, individuality, secrecy, something made by hand to decorate your body…nothing could be more luxurious right now. It is the opposite, in some ways, of the Schiaparelli approach, which lassos us in with an outrageous zoo. But isn't it dandy that one day of couture week accommodates both kinds of women? "
harper's bazar,dior,This Subversive Dior Gown Is Fit for a Modern Renegade,"In the new series, What I Loved Yesterday, Harper's BAZAAR editors highlight one standout look from the previous day at Paris Fashion Week.   The first official runway of Paris Fashion Week's fall 2023 season mesmerized me even through the semi-sharp pixels of a runway livestream. Dior collaborated with Portuguese artist Joana Vasconcelos on an immersive set titled ""Valkyrie Miss Dior,"" an homage to Christian Dior's legendary sister Catherine Dior. It took the form of a bulbous, undulating sculpture made from textile scraps and glittering embellishments that ballooned from the venue's ceiling and over the runway like a glamorous, protective guardian creature. Flower motifs throughout nodded to Catherine's profession as a florist.   Staring at it, I thought, ""It's going to be hard to take my eyes off that."" Then the show started, and I ate my words.  More than 3,600 miles away, I lost my breath for a moment when a red-magenta Dior ball gown appeared amid a collection largely filled with full midi skirts, bar jackets, and button-down shirts in a black-and-white palette. The dress wasn't the saturated cherry of fall 2023's dominant color trend. Instead, it was covered in embellishments that glistened like a scraped knee that was only halfway healed. It had the same shape as the tea-length dresses synonymous with Maria Grazia Chiuri's Dior. The ribbon belt cinched in a bow at the waist added sweetness that didn't overshadow the dress's can't-look-away beading, which appeared almost sticky. I instantly realized this was a red-carpet gown, not just for anyone, but specifically for a modern renegade.    Make no mistake: This dress sparkled with the wattage of a best-dressed contender for awards season, and I'll admit to re-watching BAZAAR fashion director Nicole Fritton's video of it gliding by on the runway more than twice. I also thought that it may have been one of the more subversive dresses on the runway.   Dior's fall 2023 collection intended to present ""a new reading of the history of the 1950s,"" according to show notes. Catherine Dior, one of the collection's three inspirations, lived through one of history's darkest periods. She was a member of the French Resistance in WWII and a concentration camp survivor. When she was released at the end of the war, she was awarded several medals of honor for her service before turning to a quiet life cultivating flowers and, later, preserving her brother's design legacy through her role as president of the Christian Dior museum.   With this context, I wondered if the ball gown was yet another way Chiuri referenced the heroine at the heart of Dior, alongside all those florals in the decor and other looks. The dress's silhouette was a house classic, but it had an edge conveying decades of strength and power.   "
harper's bazar,versace,Cher and Boyfriend Alexander Edwards Make Their Red-Carpet Debut,"Cher and boyfriend Alexander Edwards are red-carpet official.  They were among a string of celebrities who sat front row at Versace's fall/winter 2023 show in West Hollywood yesterday.  For their big debut, Cher, 76, and Edwards, 36, coordinated in stylish rocker looks. The ""I Got You Babe"" singer wore a skintight blueish-purple jumpsuit with an elaborate design and clear crystals and silver studs on the corseted bodice. Over it, she layered a metallic blue cropped jacket, also embellished with crystals and studs. Her matching electric blue leather platform boots perfectly wrapped up the colorful ensemble.  Cher continued the monochrome with her glam, opting for a shimmery blue eye shadow, pink blush, a pink glossy lip, and a French manicure with tiny crystals. Her hair was styled in silky curls, and she accessorized with a massive diamond ring.    The music producer looked cool in a black shirt, matching dress pants, a black Versace jacket with pockets and gold buttons featuring the brand's logo, and chunky black shoes. He accessorized with black Versace sunglasses and diamond earrings—a large stud and a chunky hoop—to match the tiny diamonds encrusted on his teeth.  While posing for photos on the carpet, Cher was all smiles. Edwards even leaned in to give the pop goddess a kiss.  Cher and Edwards began dating late last year after meeting during Paris Fashion Week 2022—which took place from late September to early October, and during which Cher famously walked the runway and closed Balmain's spring/summer 2023 show.  The two went public with their romance soon after, with Cher gushing about Edwards on social media and defending their 40-year age gap by saying, ""Love doesn't know math."" "
harper's bazar,versace,"Iris Law Enters the ""Versacesphere"" With Her Dylan Purple Fragrance Campaign","First Bella Hadid fronted the Versace Dylan Blue fragrance campaign, then Hailey Bieber was tapped for Dylan Turquoise. Now it's Iris Law's turn. The daughter of Jude Law and Sadie Frost is the latest familiar face to be welcomed into the family of Versace fragrances with her campaign for Dylan Purple.  For Donatella Versace, the choice to cast Law was a natural one. ""She has an amazing spirit. She is gorgeous, smart, and a little bit wild—a true Versace girl,"" she says in a brand release. ""For me, she is the perfect face for our fragrance and brings it to life with great personal style, energy, and fun.""   The campaign video sees Law clad in a purple bikini sauntering along the beach, fragrance in hand. This is the epitome of a Versace girl summer.   ""The experience of shooting the Dylan Purple campaign was so amazing and a memory I will cherish forever,"" Law tells BAZAAR. ""We spent three days on set on the most beautiful beaches in Mexico with the most incredible creative team. I have so much respect for these teams that work so hard to get things perfect. Seeing the creative vision come to life is always magic to me.""  This campaign builds off the previous Versace Dylan Turquoise fragrance campaign starring Bieber in the aim of creating a sense of an immersive ""Versacesphere."" Although the various ads share a common thread, when it comes to comparing each Dylan fragrance campaign and its respective high-profile faces, Law insists that there really is no comparing the three.   ""We are three different women, each one with her personality expressing a different way of life and woman,"" she says.  ""I represent a generation, full of life and hope, Hailey represents the sophistication of women expressed by Versace Dylan Turquoise and Bella the elegance of women expressed by Versace Dylan Blue. Of course, Dylan Purple, Dylan Turquoise, and Dylan Blue (and so me, Hailey, and Bella) have something in common: We represent the escape towards faraway islands.""  So, what about the fragrance itself? The scent, created by perfumer Christophe Raynaud,  is fresh, delicate, vibrant, and seductive. ""I created this scent as an invitation to travel,"" he says. Dylan Purple first opens with a fruity blend of sparkling bergamot, orange, and pear before transitioning into a floral heart with the heady scent of freesia and drying down to an elegant and creamy musk and cedar wood. It's the perfect scent to pack for an upcoming vacation—or to pick up at the airport on your way back. "
harper's bazar,versace,Dua Lipa Designed a Versace Collection Alongside Donatella,"Dua Lipa has long been a Versace muse. She opened and closed the spring 2022 show in Milan, was the face of the winter 2021 campaign, and is often photographed at Donatella Versace's side, in glassy iridescent Versace dresses and square-toed platform pumps. Now, the two of them have taken their partnership one step further by co-designing a see-now, buy-now Versace collection, ""La Vacanza,"" which debuted in Cannes today.   In case the South of France location didn't tip you off, la vacanza is Italian for the vacation. Lipa and Donatella embraced the feeling of a five-star vacation with a fashion show held at a scenic waterfront estate. Models walked down a runway in the center of a long pool in a series of getaway-appropriate outfits, from terrycloth cover-up dresses and bucket hats for a beach day to sexy, one-shoulder metallic sheath dresses for dancing the night away.   The collection's debut also came with a campaign starring Dua Lipa, shared on Versace's Instagram account. The imagery features the ""Don't Start Now"" singer in a low-cut polka-dot dress with butterfly flourishes and a colorful choker necklace.  ""We wanted to make the holiday wardrobe and something that I'll wear all summer, but also something other people will love and enjoy,"" Lipa said in a press conference held prior to the runway show.   This collection marks the Grammy-winning singer's first foray into design. She revealed that the collection began with sketches she drew for Donatella last fall. ""We had such a common language, we could just bounce ideas off each other,"" she said of working with the legendary designer.    From there, the pair combined Lipa's ideas with reinterpretations of archival Versace prints and silhouettes (in some cases, two archival prints layered over one another). The result is a collection that Donatella told journalists is all about ""freedom, fun, and confidence""—conveyed through details like crystal butterfly motifs atop strappy sandals and a bright, saturated palette. Many of the pieces channeled the spirit of Lipa's onstage and red-carpet wardrobes as well, with flashes of metallics, sequins, and harness details.  Earlier this spring, Donatella and Lipa announced the collection on Instagram with a black-and-white photo. Donatella is in her signature oversize aviator sunglasses, and Lipa's back is toward the camera, exposing the thong-shaped cutout of her backless gown, held together with a large gold Versace embellishment. The caption reads, ""We are excited to announce the Versace ‘La Vacanza' women's collection, which we have co-designed. We will be showing the collection on Tuesday 23rd May in Cannes, France. We cannot wait to show you what we have created!​""      In a statement following the announcement, Donatella said, ""I have always been inspired by a collaborative design process. Working with Dua on this collection has been very exciting and I love the dynamic between us. Dua is strong, fearless, and free and her creative vision is exceptional.""  In the same statement, Lipa spoke of their long-standing friendship and working relationship. ""I am absolutely thrilled to have co-designed the women's ‘La Vacanza"" collection for Versace with Donatella,"" she said. ""She and I have formed such a strong bond over the years, and I'm so grateful for the support I've received from her and the whole team since the very beginning of my career.
